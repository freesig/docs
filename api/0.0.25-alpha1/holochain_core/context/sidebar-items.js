This is the base function that many other `text_context*` functions use, and hence they also require an optional network name. The reasoning for this is that tests which only require a single instance may simply pass None and get a unique network name, but tests which require two instances to be on the same network need to ensure both contexts use the same network name."]],"struct":[["Context","Context holds the components that parts of a Holochain instance need in order to operate.
