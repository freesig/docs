initSidebarItems({"enum":[["BridgePresence","Required or optional"],["BridgeReference","This enum represents the two different ways of referring to another DNA instance. If we know a priori what exact version of another DNA we want to bridge to we can specify the DNA address (i.e. hash) and lock it in. Often, we need more flexibility when * the other DNA gets replaced by a newer version * the other DNA gets created from a template and thus we don't know the exact hash   during build-time * we want to build a complex system of components that should be pluggable. Bridges can therefore also be specified by traits. That means we specify a list of functions with their signatures and allow the conductor (through the conductor bridge config) to resolve this bridge by any DNA instance that implements all specified functions, just like a dynamic binding of function calls."]],"struct":[["Bridge","A bridge is the definition of a connection to another DNA that runs under the same agency, i.e. in the same conductor."]]});
