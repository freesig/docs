<p>Hi there! You've discovered the comprehensive Holochain guidebook.</p>
<p>Holochain is an open source software library that provides a way for businesses, communities,
and other groups to build and run applications which are hosted and validated by the &quot;users&quot; themselves.
Doing so provides a superior level of agency and autonomy over heavy reliance on the so-called &quot;cloud&quot; and other third parties.</p>
<p>These applications are known more widely as peer-to-peer, decentralized applications, or dApps. To distinguish between dApps built on Blockchains and those built on Holochain, we preemptively call the latter &quot;hApps&quot;. A more detailed comparison between Blockchain dApps and Holochain hApps is available <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">here</a>.</p>
<p>Holochain provides a cross-platform framework for the development and execution of these applications.
By running these kinds of applications, &quot;users&quot; cease to merely &quot;use&quot;. They become &quot;user-participants&quot; who are also responsible for hosting and validating the network's data. Applications can be developed utilizing any of the major operating systems, and run on virtually any device.</p>
<p>The many benefits and opportunities associated with peer-to-peer dApps (e.g. offloaded server costs, elimination of single points of failure, and flexible governance structures) are made available, and often amplified through the Holochain hApp architecture, on desktops, laptops, and Android (arm64) devices.</p>
<p>This book provides an in-depth explanation of Holochain's functions, from data validation to data propagation,
so that you can get to work straightaway on developing applications that will serve your business, community, or otherwise.</p>
<a class="header" href="#overview" id="overview"><h1>Overview</h1></a>
<p>Depending on whether your interest is specific, or general, you may wish to read it front to back, or skip to specific sections of the book. If the summary of a section describes you, then it's a section for you!</p>
<a class="header" href="#planning-a-dapp" id="planning-a-dapp"><h3>Planning a dApp</h3></a>
<p><strong>Readers:</strong> You can't put the horse before the cart. First things first:  understanding the landscape of decentralized apps. What are the mechanics of a functioning decentralized app? You have an idea of what you want to build, and you need to get a grasp on what it's going to take.

<p>This book uses a tool that builds HTML files from markdown files called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook">'mdbook'</a>. The markdown files are stored on GitHub, in the main <code>holochain-rust</code> repository. Because they are on GitHub, they have built-in version control, meaning that it's easy for anyone to contribute, and to propose, track and merge changes.</p>
<p>There are two main pathways to contribute. One is by editing files directly in GitHub, and the other is cloning the repository to your computer, running mdbook locally, and then submitting change requests. The following covers both scenarios.</p>
<a class="header" href="#writing-guidelines" id="writing-guidelines"><h2>Writing Guidelines</h2></a>
<p>Please do not edit the SUMMARY.md file, which stores the raw chapter structure, without advanced signoff from the documentation team in <a href="https://chat.holochain.org/appsup/channels/hc-core">https://chat.holochain.org/appsup/channels/hc-core</a>.</p>
<p>More forthcoming!</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-the-book-works" id="how-the-book-works"><h2>How the Book Works</h2></a>
<p>Writing is in classic markdown, so a new page is a new markdown file. These files get rendered in the book panel. One markdown file, SUMMARY.md stores the structure of the book as an outline.</p>
<p>The HTML files used in the Book get automatically built from the markdown files. Even though they're auto-generated, static HTML files, one can search within the text.</p>

<a class="header" href="#what-is-a-dapp" id="what-is-a-dapp"><h2>What is a dApp?</h2></a>
<p>A dApp is a distributed application. This means that the data associated with the application is stored by each user rather than in a central database.</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-expectations-for-dapps" id="basic-expectations-for-dapps"><h2>Basic expectations for dApps</h2></a>
<p>Generally speaking, you need to know the following in order to build a Holochain dApp:</p>
<p>how to install Holochain</p>
<p>how to use the command line tools</p>
<p>how to configure your application with a &quot;DNA&quot; file</p>
<p>how to write your application code in a language that compiles to WebAssembly</p>
<p><strong>how to think through building a distributed application</strong></p>
<p>how to build a user interface for your app</p>
<p>how to test your application code</p>
<p>This article will help you plan a dApp by providing practical considerations about the specifics of distributed applications in general, and Holochain dApps in particular. It has been remarked that holochain dApps require us to make a mental shift, first from applications whose data is centrally organized, and also from blockchain-based, data-centric dApps.</p>
<p>Here we will provide a basic overview of concepts from cryptography that are central to holochains.
Then, we will consider the consequences of Holochain's cryptographic architecture for data permissioning, access, and security.
Because app data storage is distributed amongst user-participants, one must expect that data encryption and permissions are important for protecting privacy in accordance with the jurisdictions in which the app is operating.</p>
<p>Remember that, as user-participants leave the application, they take their data with them. They also retain copies of other data that they held to support the DHT.</p>
<p>One must also re-think the dApp's business model such that it does not rely on a central authority's ability to whitelist access to a given resource.</p>
<a class="header" href="#cryptography-in-holochain-dapps" id="cryptography-in-holochain-dapps"><h2>Cryptography in Holochain dApps</h2></a>
<p>Distributed systems rely more heavily on cryptographic patterns and techniques than centralized systems. The basic concepts below explain how data integrity, ownership, and security are achieved natively with holochain's architecture. They are time-worn, relatively intuitive ideas that are critical for planning a holochain dApp.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hashes" id="hashes"><h3>Hashes</h3></a>
<p>Hashes ensure the reliability of information by representing any given piece of data with a unique, consistent string of random looking characters. This makes changes to data visible because one can see that a hash has changed without needing to inspect the data itself.</p>
<p>However, it is impossible to get the original data from a hash -- its purpose is to prove that the data to which it corresponds has not been altered. The same data consistently gives the same hash, and different data always give a completely different hash.</p>
<p>These features imply that one can use small, portable hashes to verify data. One could also use a database containing data and their hashes as a table of contents, indexing (though not reading) data associated with a given hash.</p>
<p>In the context of Holochain hashes are frequently used to look up content, both in our internal implementations as well as on the DHT.  Therefore we frequently refer to the hash of some item (i.e. an entry on the chain) as its <em>Address</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#signatures" id="signatures"><h3>Signatures</h3></a>
<p>Signatures provide an additional type of data verification, answering the question &quot;who created this data?&quot; Signatures look like hashes. They are unique, reliable, and like hashes, cannot be used to retrieve the data to which they correspond. Signatures also come with a pair of keys. One is public, and the other private.</p>
<p>The private key designates a unique author (or device), and the public key lets anyone verify a signature made by one specific private key. This key infrastructure addresses the problem of single points of failure associated with centralized systems by making authors responsible for securing their unique private key.</p>
<a class="header" href="#encryption" id="encryption"><h3>Encryption</h3></a>
<p>What if one needs to restrict access in addition to verifying data? Two types of encryption are possible. <em>Symmetric</em> encryption has one key for reading and writing data. <em>Asymmetric</em> encryption has two keys, where one creates messages and the other reads them.</p>
<p>Encryption is a two way process, so the right key enables one to decrypt an encrypted message. With this added benefit come the drawbacks of the size of encrypted messages (at least as large as the original data) and broken encryption stripping the author of control of the original data.</p>
<a class="header" href="#key-management" id="key-management"><h3>Key Management</h3></a>
<p>Once you are using cryptographic functions, either signing or encrypting, managing and securing the keys that unlock these functions, becomes a huge challenge to maintaining the overall system's integrity because there have to be safe ways to generate and store keys and also verify the provenance of the keys being used.  In Holochain we have designed for a Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) in which we leverage the distributed nature of Holochain itself to help manage all the aspects of this challenge.</p>
<a class="header" href="#data-access-paradigms" id="data-access-paradigms"><h2>Data access paradigms</h2></a>
<p>The following are five data access paradigms. Note that in real-world scenarios it is common to mix these options by combining separate dApps.
In instances when many separate dApps are needed to share data, Holochain supports bridging between dApps.
Bridges between two networks with different data privacy models specify who can use the bridge, what data crosses the bridge, and tasks that might run in response to the bridge (e.g. notifications)</p>
<p>The default model for Holochain data is public data shared on a public network, and every Holochain dApp has its own network and data, and creates networks for user-participants as soon as they join a dApp.
The dApp code sets sharing and verification rules.</p>
<a class="header" href="#public-shared-data-on-a-public-network" id="public-shared-data-on-a-public-network"><h3>Public, shared data on a public network</h3></a>
<p>Public data works like Bittorrent:</p>
<ul>
<li>anybody can join a network</li>
<li>anybody can request any data they want from the network</li>
<li>any data is available as long as at least one person is sharing it</li>
<li>if some data is not shared by enough people, a new random person on the network must share it</li>
<li>there is no &quot;local only&quot; data</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, an additional requirement for Holochain dApps is that new data must have a digital signature.</p>
<a class="header" href="#public-shared-data-on-a-private-network" id="public-shared-data-on-a-private-network"><h3>Public, shared data on a private network</h3></a>
<p>The functionality is the same as a public network, but private networks use cryptography for access control to the network itself.</p>
<p>Each device on the network must open a P2P connection to another device before it can send any data.
The devices that are already on the private network send a challenge to any new device before sending any more data.
The new device must sign the challenge with the network private key.
The network public key is set in the dApp configuration, available to Holochain.
Holochain can then refuse any connection with a bad challenge signature.
Data within the network is public and shared. Every device on the network has “logged in” with a signed challenge, so has full access.</p>
<a class="header" href="#encrypted-data-on-a-public-or-private-network" id="encrypted-data-on-a-public-or-private-network"><h3>Encrypted data on a public or private network</h3></a>
<p>Encryption relies on dApp developers encrypting and decrypting data within the dApp software.</p>
<p>Holochain exposes a set of industry standard encryption algorithms (e.g. AES) to each dApp that cover both symmetric and asymmetric encryption options, in addition to hashing and signing tools.</p>
<p>This option is very flexible for dApp developers but security becomes more subtle.
Much like the private network, any one user-participant losing a key can become a serious security problem.</p>
<p>Note that encryption can pose problems for Holochain's native validation method.</p>
<a class="header" href="#private-local-only-data" id="private-local-only-data"><h3>Private, local only data</h3></a>
<p>Any data in a dApp can be validated and stored by its author without being shared to the network. Private, local data can provide a useful database for portable user preferences and notes and avoids the complexity of encryption and key-based security.</p>
<p>Private data is hashed in the same way as public data, and the hash is public. Accordingly, one could tell that private data exists without being able to access it or take advantage of this with dApps that feature the eventual reveal of previously authored, private data -- think a distributed guessing game, like &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot; or a digital classroom that operates with signatures disconnected from real-world identity and uses this method to prevent cheating.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hybrid-model-with-servers" id="hybrid-model-with-servers"><h3>Hybrid model with servers</h3></a>
<p>Holochain supports many different environments and interfaces so that Holochain is easy to integrate with existing infrastructure. Any connected system with an API can push data through a dApp, as when one's phone sends a summary of private calendar data to a Holochain dApp. Any data in a dApp immediately becomes transparent, auditable and portable.</p>
<p>The version of Holochain in active development covers the following integrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command line tools</li>
<li>Web server</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>Qt/QML</li>
<li>Unity 3D games engine</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#security---best-practices" id="security---best-practices"><h2>Security - best practices</h2></a>
<p>A great way to begin offsetting the governance crises now typical of distributed systems (i.e. DAO hack) is to think in terms of protecting and enabling the community of user-participants in addition to cryptography.</p>
<p>In essence, one must consider how to prevent undesired access to the DHT. If membranes are not properly built in the dApps' DNA, having access to the source code also means having access to the entire network's entries via the DHT. Developers must treat the code, or at least the DNA taken as a whole, as if it's a key to the data. Note, too, that one can easily fork a Holochain dApp without disrupting its activity, making it possible to retain the benefits of open-source code without some of the risks.</p>
<a class="header" href="#membranes" id="membranes"><h3>Membranes</h3></a>
<p>Security efforts begin with the specification of membranes, lest the code itself become a target. Though holochains rely on the cryptography above to create trust in data's provenance and immutability, trust is a distinctly human affair at the level of creating membranes. Different applications will require different levels of security, and Holochain is uniquely suited to accommodate a high degree of flexibility. DNA could define a closed list of participants, Proof of Service, or social triangulation requirements, for example.</p>
<p>Sybil attacks are attacks launched through the creation of many nodes explicitly for the purpose of the attack. These nodes are identifiable by having no history. Blockchains prevent Sybil Attacks with Proof of Work. PoW is an implied membrane since it constrains who can verify blocks. In that case, the clearing node must have done &quot;work&quot; to maintain the network. Holochain requires membranes to identify and filter out Sybil nodes so that an attacker cannot use them to overrun the DHT.</p>
<a class="header" href="#immune-system" id="immune-system"><h3>Immune system</h3></a>
<p>Holochain relies on random users across the network validating every piece of data. This keeps the verification rules reliable and unbiased. This is called an &quot;immune system&quot; for validating content.</p>
<p>Note that when using encrypted data, it is not possible to verify contents without the appropriate key. Encryption is a choice that should be made carefully, as it undermines Holochain's native immune system.</p>

<a class="header" href="#building-apps" id="building-apps"><h1>Building Apps</h1></a>
<p>If you're looking to build a Holochain app, it is important to first know what a Holochain app is.</p>
<p>First, recall that Holochain is an engine that can run your distributed apps. That engine expects and requires your application to be in a certain format that is unique to Holochain. That format is referred to as the &quot;DNA&quot; of your application. The DNA of an application exists as a single file, which is mounted and executed by Holochain.</p>
<p>Writing your application in a single file would not be feasible or desirable, however. Instead, you are supplied the tools to store your application code across a set of files within a folder, and tools to build all that code down into one file, in the DNA format.</p>
<p>While there are lots of details to learn about Holochain and DNA, it can be useful to first look from a general perspective.</p>
<a class="header" href="#holochain-and-dna" id="holochain-and-dna"><h2>Holochain and DNA</h2></a>
<p>Recall that a goal of Holochain is to enable cryptographically secured, tamper-proof peer-to-peer applications. DNA files play a fundamental role in enabling this. Imagine that we think of an application and its users as a game. When people play any game, it's important that they play by the same rules -- otherwise, they are actually playing different games. With Holochain, a DNA file contains the complete set of rules and logic for an application. Thus, when users independently run an app with identical DNA, they are playing the same game -- running the same application with cryptographic security.</p>
<p>What this allows in technical terms is that these independent users can begin sharing data with one another and validating one anothers data. Thus, users can interact with the data in this distributed peer-to-peer system with full confidence in the integrity of that data.</p>
<p>The key takeaway from this is that if you change the DNA (the configuration, validation rules, and application logic) and a user runs it, they are basically running a different app. If this brings up questions for you about updating your application to different versions, good catch. This concern will be addressed later in this section.</p>
<p>Before exploring the details of Holochain DNA, take a minute to explore the different platforms that you can target with Holochain.</p>
<a class="header" href="#introduction-to-dna-configuration" id="introduction-to-dna-configuration"><h1>Introduction to DNA: Configuration</h1></a>
<p>As a developer, you won't have to interact directly with the contents of a DNA file that often. However, it is quite important to grasp its role and structure.</p>
<p>Holochain DNA files are written in a data format known as JSON. It stores sets of key-value pairs, and allows a nested tree structure. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;property_name&quot;: &quot;property_value&quot;,
  &quot;nest_name&quot;: {
    &quot;nested_property_name&quot;: &quot;nested_property_value&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>JSON is usually used for configuration and static data, but in the case of Holochain, these DNA files also contain compiled code, which is executable by Holochain.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, you do not need to edit this &quot;master&quot; DNA file directly. Holochain command line tools can be used to build it from your raw files.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/tree/develop/cli#usage">Learn more about the package command which fulfills this function</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#configuration" id="configuration"><h2>Configuration</h2></a>
<p>For the configuration-related parts of your DNA, they will come from actual JSON files stored in your application folder. There will be multiple JSON files nested in the folder structure. An application folder should have a file in its root called <code>app.json</code>.</p>
<p>This file should define various properties of your application. Some of these properties Holochain fully expects and will not work without, others can be customised to your application.</p>
<a class="header" href="#appjson-properties" id="appjson-properties"><h3>app.json Properties</h3></a>
<p>A default <code>app.json</code> file looks roughly like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Holochain App Name&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A Holochain app&quot;,
  &quot;authors&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;Author Name &lt;author@name.com&gt;&quot;,
      &quot;public_key_source&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
      &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,
  &quot;dht&quot;: {},
  &quot;properties&quot;: null
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#intro-to-dna-code" id="intro-to-dna-code"><h1>Intro to DNA: Code</h1></a>
<p>The functionality of Holochain applications is written as a collection of logical modules called &quot;Zomes&quot;.</p>
<p>Zomes are created inside a folder called <code>zomes</code>, and each Zome should have its own sub-folder within that, in which the configuration and code for that particular Zome should be placed.</p>
<p>These Zomes can call and access the functionality of the others, but they are written independently.</p>
<p>When the DNA file is being packaged, the code for these Zomes is encoded using Base64 encoding and combined with the configuration file associated with the Zome.</p>
<p>The configuration file should be a JSON file, stored in the Zome folder. The file can be named anything, but the default is <code>zome.json</code>.</p>
<p>This Zome file is extremely simplistic at this point, and contains only a <code>description</code> property, which is a human readable property that describes what the Zome is for.</p>
<p>The only coding language that Holochain knows how to execute is WebAssembly. However, it is unlikely that you'll want to write WebAssembly code by hand. Instead, most people will write their Zomes' code in <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">a language that can compile to WebAssembly</a>, such as Rust or Assemblyscript, and then define a build step in which it is compiled to WebAssembly. There is already a large, and growing, number of languages that compile to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>If this is sounding complex, don't worry. There are tools supplied to make this easy, and you'll be writing in a language that's familiar, or easy to learn.</p>
<p>With this overview in mind, the details of app development can be explored.</p>

<p>There are a set of custom-designed tools for working with Holochain that can be installed as utilities to your command line to simplify and accelerate the process of Holochain app development. These command line tools are required if you wish to be able to attempt what you are reading about as you continue through the articles on building an app.</p>
<p>However, the command line tools are automatically installed when setting up a development environment, as detailed in the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/start.html">quick start installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the installation instructions, there is also an <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/blob/develop/doc/architecture/README.md">architectural overview</a> of the different functions of the command line tools. You will also learn these organically just by proceeding through the other articles in this chapter and the ones that follow.</p>
<a class="header" href="#create-a-new-project" id="create-a-new-project"><h1>Create A New Project</h1></a>
<p>The command line tools discussed in the last article can be used to easily create a new folder on your computer, that contains all the initial folders and files needed for a Holochain application.</p>
<p>You will typically want to create a new project folder for a Holochain application this way.  This one approach will suit the creation of a new Holochain app or implementing an existing app with Holochain instead.</p>
<p>In your terminal, change directories to one where you wish to initialize a new Holochain app. The command will create a new folder within the current directory for your app.</p>
<p>Come up with a name for your application, or at least for your project folder.</p>
<p>Copy or type the command below into your terminal, except replace <code>your_app_name</code> with the name you came up with. Press <code>Enter</code> to execute the command.</p>
<p>Again, make sure you have followed the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/start.html">quick start guide</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ nix-shell https://holochain.love
# snip
[nix-shell:~]$ hc init your_app_name
Created new Holochain project at: &quot;your_app_name&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><code>hc</code> specifies that you wish to use the Holochain command line tools. <code>init</code> specifies to use the command for initializing a new project folder. <code>your_app_name</code> is an argument you supply as the app, and folder name.</p>
<p>This has created a new folder in which you have the beginnings of a Holochain app.</p>
<p>Check out the next article to see what the contents of a DNA source code folder looks like.</p>
<a class="header" href="#project-source-folders" id="project-source-folders"><h1>Project Source Folders</h1></a>
<p>The source code folder for a Holochain DNA project looks something like this, where the ellipses (...) indicate a folder</p>
<ul>
<li>test
<ul>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zomes
<ul>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>.gitignore</li>
<li>.hcignore</li>
<li>app.json</li>
</ul>
<p><code>test</code> contains some starter code for writing tests.</p>
<p><code>zomes</code> will contain sub-folders, each of which represents a &quot;Zome&quot;, which can be thought of as a submodule of the source code of your DNA.</p>
<p><code>.gitignore</code> contains useful defaults for ignoring files when using GIT version control.</p>
<p><code>.hcignore</code> is utilized by the packaging commands of the <code>hc</code> command line tools</p>
<p><code>app.json</code> is the top level configuration of your DNA.</p>
<p>Carry on to the next article to see about making changes to the configuration of a new project.</p>
<a class="header" href="#configuring-an-app" id="configuring-an-app"><h1>Configuring an App</h1></a>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="./intro_to_dna_config.html">Intro to DNA: Configuration</a> at the top level of a Holochain app source code folder there should be a file named <code>app.json</code>. This file is useful for two primary things:</p>
<ol>
<li>When executing your application, Holochain can adopt specific behaviours, that can be configured in the <code>app.json</code> file. These mostly relate to how the Distributed Hash Table and P2P gossip functions.</li>
<li>You can give app users, and other developers background info about your application, such as the name of the app, and the author.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are the properties currently in use:</p>

<a class="header" href="#writing-in-rust" id="writing-in-rust"><h1>Writing in Rust</h1></a>
<p>It has always been in the designs for Holochain to support programming in multiple languages. In the prototype of Holochain, Zomes could be written in variants of Javascript (ES5) and Lisp (Zygomys). In the new version of Holochain the primary &quot;Ribosome&quot;, where there was a JS one and Lisp one before, interprets WebAssembly code.</p>
<p>While we will provide a small introduction to WebAssembly shortly, we should also briefly introduce Rust, since it is the first language that has a first class Holochain app development experience, with its' WebAssembly compilation. This is accomplished via a Holochain Development Kit (HDK) library which has been written for Rust.</p>
<p>For the time being, writing Holochain apps requires writing code in Rust. This will not always be the case. <a href="https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript">Assemblyscript</a>, a language based off Typescript, is the next likely language in which there will be an HDK library. If it happens to interest you, there is an article here about <a href="../writing_development_kit.html">writing an HDK</a>, since that is something we also invite and encourage the community to do.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:
&quot;Rust is a systems programming language with a focus on safety, especially safe concurrency, supporting both functional and imperative paradigms.&quot;</p>
<p>Rust is a strongly typed language, which is desirable for the development of secure P2P applications, and compilation from Rust to WebAssembly is extremely easy.</p>
<p>If Rust is new to you, don't worry. With lots of Holochain app development happening in an open source way, and through learning resources like this guidebook, and the &quot;Rust book&quot; you will have lots to reference to get started.</p>
<p>While there are lots of other materials available for learning Rust, the base materials for the language are always a good resource to go back to: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/">Rust Docs</a>.</p>
<p>In many articles in the following chapters, you will find that there is a dedicated section at the bottom of the article called &quot;Building in Rust&quot;. This typically follows after a general discussion of a concept, and is done this way because implementation details may differ based on the language developers are writing Zomes in.</p>
<a class="header" href="#writing-in-assemblyscript" id="writing-in-assemblyscript"><h1>Writing in Assemblyscript</h1></a>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="./rust.html">writing in Rust</a> Assemblyscript is a language based off of Typescript, which is designed to compile to WebAssembly. It is hoped that Assemblyscript will soon be mature enough, and have the necessary features, to be able to have an HDK for it. Work on an HDK for Assemblyscript commenced mid 2018, but hit roadblocks.</p>
<p>Updates on this should appear in a number of places:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/holochain">the Holochain medium publication</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/holochain/hdk-assemblyscript">the hdk-assemblyscript repository</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#intro-to-webassembly" id="intro-to-webassembly"><h1>Intro to WebAssembly</h1></a>
<p>What is WebAssembly exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;WebAssembly is a standard being developed by the W3C group for an efficient, lightweight instruction set. This means we can compile different types of programming languages ranging from C/C++, Go, Rust, and more into a single standard... WebAssembly, or WASM, for short, is memory-safe,platform independent, and maps well to all types of CPU architectures efficiently.&quot; - <a href="https://medium.com/zkcapital/webassembly-the-future-of-blockchain-computing-1a0ae28f7e40">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though initially designed for use by major browsers IE, Chrome, Firefox and Safari, WASM has quickly been taken up as a portable target for execution on native platforms as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org">WebAssembly.org</a> describes it as a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.</p>
<p>Despite being a binary format, &quot;WebAssembly is designed to be pretty-printed in a textual format for debugging, testing, experimenting, optimizing, learning, teaching, and writing programs by hand.&quot;</p>
<p>This textual format is called WAT.</p>
<p>Not because it needs to be understood, but so that you can get a glimpse of what WAT looks like, here's a little sample:</p>
<pre><code>(module
    (memory (;0;) 1)
    (func (export &quot;public_test_fn&quot;) (param $p0 i64) (result i64)
        i64.const 6
    )
    (data (i32.const 0)
        &quot;1337.0&quot;
    )
    (export &quot;memory&quot; (memory 0))
)
</code></pre>
<p>Once the above code is converted from WAT to binary WASM it is in the format that could be executed by the Holochain WASM interpreter.</p>
<p>Often times, for a language that compiles to WASM, you will have a configuration option to generate the (more) human readable WAT version of the code as well, while compiling it to WASM.</p>
<p>While the compilation to WASM mostly happens in the background for you as an app developer, having a basic understanding of the role of WebAssembly in this technology stack will no doubt help you along the way.</p>
<a class="header" href="#updating-from-holochain-proto-to-holochain-rust" id="updating-from-holochain-proto-to-holochain-rust"><h1>Updating from holochain-proto to holochain-rust</h1></a>
<p>If you wrote an application for <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto">holochain-proto</a>, you are likely wondering what it may take to port your app to the new <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto">holochain-rust</a> version of Holochain.</p>
<p>The following should provide multiple levels of insight into what this could involve.</p>
<p>At a very general level:</p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of code, you have at least 2 options
<ul>
<li>rewriting the code in Rust</li>
<li>waiting for Assemblyscript support, and migrating at that point to Assemblyscript (the caveat to this approach is that it is not yet known at which point this support will arrive)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The API between a user interface and Holochain has switched from HTTP to Websockets (for now), and so any user interface must be updated to use this approach.</li>
<li>The DNA file has been simplified. Less is defined as JSON in the dna.json file and more is defined in the code.</li>
<li>Testing of DNA utilizes Nodejs to run tests, using the testing library of your choice. This replaces the custom (and limited) JSON test configuration employed by holochain-proto.</li>
<li>Schemas for entry types are no longer defined using json-schema, but using native Rust structs.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the level of the code, in more detail, the changes are as follows (note that this is in reference to Javascript Zomes being ported to Rust Zomes):</p>
<ul>
<li>all camel case function names are now snake case</li>
<li><code>makeHash</code> is now named <code>entry_address</code></li>
<li><code>commit</code> is now named <code>commit_entry</code></li>
<li><code>get</code> is now named <code>get_entry</code></li>
<li><code>update</code> is now named <code>update_entry</code></li>
<li><code>remove</code> is now named <code>remove_entry</code></li>
<li>Links are no longer created using <code>commit</code>, but instead have their own method, named <code>link_entries</code></li>
<li>Instead of being implicitly imported, the Zome API functions are explicitly imported into Zomes, e.g.
<code>extern crate hdk;</code></li>
<li>The code of each Zome must now utilize a Rust &quot;macro&quot; called &quot;define_zome!&quot;, and its various subproperties, which did not previously exist.</li>
<li>Many aspects of validation have changed, see the section below on validation</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#updating-validation" id="updating-validation"><h3>Updating Validation</h3></a>
<p>There is a conceptual change to the approach to validation of entries, and even whereabouts that logic lives in the code.</p>
<p>In <code>holochain-proto</code>, there were a number of hooks which Holochain would call back into, to perform validation, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>validateCommit</li>
<li>validatePut</li>
<li>validateMod</li>
<li>validateDel</li>
<li>validateLink</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how many entry types there were, there would still be only 5 callbacks defined maximum. These validation callbacks were performed at a certain stage in the lifecycle of an entry.</p>
<p>Now, an entry type is defined all in one place, including its validation rules, which are unique to it as an entry type.
This could look as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, DefaultJson)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
entry!(
    name: &quot;person&quot;,
    description: &quot;&quot;,
    sharing: Sharing::Public,
    native_type: Person,
    validation_package: || {
        hdk::ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry
    },
    validation: |person: Person, validation_data: hdk::ValidationData| {
        (person.name.len() &gt;= 2)
            .ok_or_else(|| String::from(&quot;Name must be at least 2 characters&quot;))
    }
)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The callback <code>validation</code>, replaces <code>validateCommit</code> and all the rest from holochain-proto. However, validation still happens at various times in the lifecycle of an entry, so if the validation is to operate differently between initial <code>commit</code> to the chain, <code>update</code>, or <code>remove</code>, then that logic must be written into this single validation function. To determine which context validation is being called within, you can check in a property of the second parameter of the callback, which in the example above is called <code>validation_data</code>.</p>
<p>For this, you can use the Rust <code>match</code> operator, and check against the <code>validation_data.action</code>. It will be one of an enum that can be seen in detail <a href="/api/0.0.26-alpha1/hdk/enum.EntryAction.html">in the API reference</a>.</p>

Perhaps the most interesting feature of Comet, though, is its voting system. Firstly, votes can be fractional, they range from -1 to 1. Votes are also not counted as &quot;objective&quot;. The scores of posts and comments are always calculated from the perspective of a particular agent (the user). This agent will have upvoted and downvoted other posts from other people. The score is counted depending on how the agent has voted on the other voters in the past.

The Infinite World Game (IWG) is an unprecedented innovation. A vision and whole-systems platform for a society and world that does things differently.  Cocreative players in the IWG organise themselves as living cells in a planetary super-organism (or ‘Universal Fractal Organism’, UFO), where ‘thriveability’ is the new name of the game for humanity and the planet. Drawing on a new world view and the principles of living systems, the IWG moves beyond our current concepts of economics and social organisation and offers a fresh way to share and regulate resources, interrelate, develop innovations, realise ourselves and co-ordinate our intelligence. As we elevate our capacity as a species, the IWG reorganises our social processes to go beyond product and profitability alone towards a world where every action is creating more life, love and thriveability for all.&quot;</li>

<a class="header" href="#building-for-different-platforms" id="building-for-different-platforms"><h1>Building for Different Platforms</h1></a>
<p>Holochain is designed to run on many different platforms.  Essentially it can run on any platform that Rust and the Rust WASM interpreter targets.  Thus Holochain DNA's will be able to run on platforms ranging from Raspberry Pis to Android smartphones once the tools have been fully developed.</p>
<p>We have experimented with C bindings that allowed us to run Holochain DNAs, in a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.11/qtqml-index.html">Qt and Qml</a> based cross-platform deployment, which besides running on desktop machines also <a href="./building_for_android.html">worked on Android</a>.</p>
<p>We expect other approaches to running Holochain apps on different platforms to proliferate, including compiling Holochain directly in your native application, whether it be an Electron app, a command-line Rust based app, or an Android app.</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-holochain-apps-zome-code" id="building-holochain-apps-zome-code"><h1>Building Holochain Apps: Zome Code</h1></a>
<p>Recall that for the DNA of a hApp, there can be many Zomes, and each one will have their own source code. Think of Zomes as the fundamental unit of composability for DNA.  As a DNA developer you can think of Zomes as modules. We expect developers to reuse Zomes written by others, and thus Zomes can call one another's functionality, using the <code>call</code> API function. Though currently Rust is the only available language for writing Zomes, note that these Zomes could be written in different languages (any language that compiles to WebAssembly) from one another in the future, and still access one another's functionality.</p>
<p>While writing the source code for DNA, it is extremely important to verify, before putting it into people's hands, that the code works as expected. For this reason, there are tools for testing included by default in newly generated projects. While there are technically a variety of ways that testing could be accomplished, and you could build your own, the most accessible of those is included by default, which is a JavaScript/nodejs Holochain Conductor. What this means is that the full scope of writing DNA, as of this writing, is likely for most people to include source code in two languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>In the near future, this is likely to expand in diversity on both sides, Zome code and testing code.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, there will be plenty of examples given as to writing Zome code in Rust.</p>
<p>This chapter starts with a step by step tutorial, and goes on with a detailed explanation of the affordances of Holochain, and how to use its core functions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#first-steps-writing-holochain-happs-with-rust" id="first-steps-writing-holochain-happs-with-rust"><h1>First steps writing Holochain hApps with Rust</h1></a>
<hr />
<p>This tutorial builds for the 0.0.18-alpha1 release but as the API and HDK are changing it will likely fail under newer releases.</p>
<hr />
<p>Holochain hApps are made of compiled WebAssembly that encodes the rules of the hApp, the data it can store and how users will interact with it. This means that <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">any language that can compile to WebAssembly</a> can one day be used for Holochain.</p>
<p>Writing WebAssembly that complies with the Holochain runtime can be tricky. To make development as streamlined as possible the core team has been developing a Holochain-dev-kit (HDK) for the first supported language, Rust! In the near future the community is encouraged to develop an HDK for their language of choice.</p>
<p>In this article we will walk through the steps of creating a simple hApp using Rust.</p>
<a class="header" href="#requirements" id="requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>
<p>First step is to download the appropriate <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/releases">dev preview release</a> for your OS. If you decide to build the latest version from source, be warned that the API is undergoing rapid change, so some of the steps in this article may not work. The release contains the binary for the holochain developer command line tool, <code>hc</code>, which is used to generate a skeleton app, run tests and build the app package. Follow the installations on <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/start.html">this page</a> to install the required dependencies.</p>
<p>Ensure that <code>hc</code> is available on your path. If you instead decide to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/start.html">build from source</a> cargo will ensure the binaries are on your path automatically.</p>
<p>If you want to jump ahead to see what the completed project will look like, the <a href="https://github.com/willemolding/holochain-rust-todo">full source code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#first-steps" id="first-steps"><h2>First steps</h2></a>
<p>We will be making a classic to-do list hApp. A user can create new lists and add items to a list. They should also be able to retrieve a list by its address and all of the items on each list.</p>
<p>Let's begin by generating an empty hApp skeleton by running:</p>
<pre><code>hc init holochain-rust-todo
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate the following directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>holochain-rust-todo/
├── app.json
├── test
│ └── …
└── zomes
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>zomes</code> directory. All Holochain hApps are comprised of one or more zomes. They can be thought of as similar to modules in JavaScript, each one should provide some self-contained functionality. Every zome has its own build system so it is possible to combine zomes written in different languages to produce a single hApp.</p>
<p>We will create a single zome called <code>lists</code> that uses a Rust build system:</p>
<pre><code>cd holochain-rust-todo
hc generate zomes/lists rust
</code></pre>
<p>The project structure should now be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>├── app.json
├── test
│ └── …
└── zomes
 └── lists
 ├── code
 │ ├── .hcbuild
 │ ├── Cargo.toml
 │ └── src
 │  └── lib.rs
 └── zome.json
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#writing-the-lists-zome" id="writing-the-lists-zome"><h2>Writing the lists zome</h2></a>
<p>The Rust HDK makes use of Rust macros to reduce the need for boilerplate code. The most important of which is the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/api/0.0.26-alpha1/hdk/macro.define_zome.html"><code>define_zome!</code></a> macro. Every zome must use this to define the structure of the zome, what entries it contains, which functions it exposes and what to do on first start-up (init).</p>
<p>Open up <code>lib.rs</code> and replace its contents with the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[macro_use]
extern crate hdk;

define_zome! {
    entries: [
    ]

    init: || {
        Ok(())
    }

    validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }

    functions: [
    ]

    traits: {
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is the simplest possible zome with no entries and no exposed functions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-some-entries" id="adding-some-entries"><h2>Adding some Entries</h2></a>
<p>Unlike in holochain-proto, where you needed to define a JSON schema to validate entries, holochain entries in Rust map to a native struct type. We can define our list and listItem structs as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, DefaultJson)]
struct List {
    name: String
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, DefaultJson)]
struct ListItem {
    text: String,
    completed: bool
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, DefaultJson)]
struct GetListResponse {
    name: String,
    items: Vec&lt;ListItem&gt;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>You might notice that the <code>List</code> struct does not contain a field that holds a collection of <code>ListItem</code>s. This will be implemented using links, which we will discuss later.</p>
<p>Also be sure to add the following to the list of imports:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[macro_use]
extern crate hdk;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;
#[macro_use]
extern crate holochain_persistence_derive;
use hdk::{
    error::ZomeApiResult,
    holochain_core_types::{
        hash::HashString,
        error::HolochainError,
        dna::entry_types::Sharing,
        json::JsonString,
        cas::content::Address,
        entry::Entry,
    }
};
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code> derived traits allow the structs to be converted to and from JSON, which is how entries are managed internally in Holochain. The DefaultJson derived trait comes from the holochain HDK itself and allows for seamless converting between data stored in the DHT and rust structs.</p>
<p>These structs on their own are not yet valid Holochain entries. To create these we must include them in the <code>define_zome!</code> macro by using the <code>entry!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// -- SNIP-- //

define_zome! {
    entries: [
        entry!(
            name: &quot;list&quot;,
            description: &quot;&quot;,
            sharing: Sharing::Public,
            validation_package: || hdk::ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry,
            validation: |validation_data: hdk::EntryValidationData&lt;List&gt;| {
                Ok(())
            },
            links: [
                to!(
                    &quot;listItem&quot;,
                    link_type: &quot;items&quot;,
                    validation_package: || hdk::ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry,
                    validation: |_validation_data: hdk::LinkValidationData| {
                        Ok(())
                    }
                )
            ]
        ),
        entry!(
            name: &quot;listItem&quot;,
            description: &quot;&quot;,
            sharing: Sharing::Public,
            validation_package: || hdk::ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry,
            validation: |validation_data: hdk::EntryValidationData&lt;ListItem&gt;| {
                Ok(())
            }
        )
    ]

// -- SNIP-- //
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Take note of the <code>native_type</code> field of the macro which gives which Rust struct represents the entry type. The <code>validation_package</code> field is a function that defines what data should be passed to the validation function through the <code>ctx</code> argument. In this case we use a predefined function to only include the entry itself, but it is also possible to pass chain headers, chain entries or the full local chain. The validation field is a function that performs custom validation for the entry. In both our cases we are just returning <code>Ok(())</code>.</p>
<p>Take note also of the <code>links</code> field. As we will see later links are the main way to encode relational data in holochain. The <code>links</code> section of the entry macro defines what other types of entries are allowed to link to and from this type. This also includes a validation function for fine grain control over linking.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-functions" id="adding-functions"><h2>Adding Functions</h2></a>
<p>Finally we need a way to interact with the hApp. We will define the following functions: <code>create_list</code>, <code>add_item</code> and <code>get_list</code>. get_list will retrieve a list and all the items linked to each list.</p>
<p>For each of these functions we must define a handler, which is a Rust function that will be executed when the conductor calls the function. (For more on conductors, read Nico's recent post.) It is best practice for functions to always return a <code>ZomeApiResult&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> is the type the function should return if it runs without error. This is an extension of the Rust Result type and allows zome functions to abort early on errors using the <code>?</code> operator. At the moment the handler function names cannot be the same as the function itself so we will prefix them with <code>handle_</code>. This will be fixed in an upcoming release. The handler for <code>create_list</code> could be written as:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn handle_create_list(list: List) -&gt; ZomeApiResult&lt;Address&gt; {
    // define the entry
    let list_entry = Entry::App(
        &quot;list&quot;.into(),
        list.into()
    );

    // commit the entry and return the address
    hdk::commit_entry(&amp;list_entry)
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>hdk::commit_entry</code> function is how a zome can interact with holochain core to add entries to the DHT or local chain. This will trigger the validation function for the entry and if successful will store the entry and return its hash/address.</p>
<p>The <code>add_item</code> function requires the use of holochain links to associate two entries. In holochain-proto this required the use of a commit with a special Links entry but it can now be done using the HDK function <code>link_entries(address1, address2, link_type, tag)</code>. The <code>link_type</code> must exactly match one of the types of links defined in an <code>entry!</code> macro for this base (e.g. <code>link_type: &quot;items&quot;</code> in this case). The <code>tag</code> can be any string we wish to associate with this individual link. We will just use an empty string for this example. The add item handler accepts a <code>ListItem</code> and an address of a list, commits the <code>ListItem</code>, then links it to the list address:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn handle_add_item(list_item: ListItem, list_addr: HashString) -&gt; ZomeApiResult&lt;Address&gt; {
    // define the entry
    let list_item_entry = Entry::App(
        &quot;listItem&quot;.into(),
        list_item.into()
    );

    let item_addr = hdk::commit_entry(&amp;list_item_entry)?; // commit the list item
    hdk::link_entries(&amp;list_addr, &amp;item_addr, &quot;items&quot;, &quot;&quot;)?; // if successful, link to list address
    Ok(item_addr)
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>At the moment there is no validation done on the link entries. This will be added soon with an additional validation callback.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>get_list</code> requires us to use the HDK function <code>get_links(base_address, link_type, tag)</code>. As you may have guessed, this will return the addresses of all the entries that are linked to the <code>base_address</code> with a given link_type and a given tag. Both <code>link_type</code> and <code>tag</code> are LinkMatch types, which is an enum for matching anything, matching exactly, or matching with a regular expression. Passing <code>LinkMatch::Exactly(&quot;string&quot;)</code> means retrieve links that match the type/tag string exactly and passing <code>LinkMatch::Any</code> to either of them means to retrieve all links regardless of the type/tag. As this only returns the addresses, we must then map over each of then and load the required entry.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn handle_get_list(list_addr: HashString) -&gt; ZomeApiResult&lt;GetListResponse&gt; {

    // load the list entry. Early return error if it cannot load or is wrong type
    let list = hdk::utils::get_as_type::&lt;List&gt;(list_addr.clone())?;

    // try and load the list items, filter out errors and collect in a vector
    let list_items = hdk::get_links(&amp;list_addr, LinkMatch::Exactly(&quot;items&quot;), LinkMatch::Any)?.addresses()
        .iter()
        .map(|item_address| {
            hdk::utils::get_as_type::&lt;ListItem&gt;(item_address.to_owned())
        })
        .filter_map(Result::ok)
        .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;ListItem&gt;&gt;();

    // if this was successful then return the list items
    Ok(GetListResponse{
        name: list.name,
        items: list_items
    })
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Phew! That is all the handlers set up. Finally the function definitions must be added to the <code>define_zome!</code> macro. Before doing that, it is worth briefly discussing a new concept in Holochain, <em>traits</em>. Traits allow functions to be grouped to control access and in the future will allow hApps to connect to other hApps that implement a particular trait. At this time the only trait we need to consider is the hc_public trait. This is a special named trait that exposes all of the contained functions to the outside world.</p>
<p>The function field of our zome definition should be updated to:</p>
<pre><code>define_zome! {

    // -- SNIP-- //
    functions: [
        create_list: {
            inputs: |list: List|,
            outputs: |result: ZomeApiResult&lt;Address&gt;|,
            handler: handle_create_list
        }
        add_item: {
            inputs: |list_item: ListItem, list_addr: HashString|,
            outputs: |result: ZomeApiResult&lt;Address&gt;|,
            handler: handle_add_item
        }
        get_list: {
            inputs: |list_addr: HashString|,
            outputs: |result: ZomeApiResult&lt;GetListResponse&gt;|,
            handler: handle_get_list
        }
        ]
        traits: {
        hc_public [create_list, add_item, get_list]
        }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and there we have it! If you are coding along the full lib.rs should now look like this:</p>

<p>The Zome we created should now build if we run:</p>
<pre><code>hc package
</code></pre>
<p>from the root directory. This will compile the Rust to WebAssembly and produce a <code>holochain-rust-todo.dna.json</code> file in the <code>dist</code> folder which contains the compiled WASM code and the required metadata. This is the file that we can load and run using <code>hc</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#writing-tests" id="writing-tests"><h2>Writing tests</h2></a>
<p>The testing framework is built on JavaScript around Tape.js and allows for writing single agent and muti-agent tests using javascript async/await syntax.
Opening up the <code>test/index.js</code> file you will see a skeleton test file already created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// This test file uses the tape testing framework.
// To learn more, go here: https://github.com/substack/tape
const { Config, Scenario } = require(&quot;@holochain/holochain-nodejs&quot;)
Scenario.setTape(require(&quot;tape&quot;))

const dnaPath = &quot;./dist/holochain-rust-todo.dna.json&quot;
const agentAlice = Config.agent(&quot;alice&quot;)
const dna = Config.dna(dnaPath)
const instanceAlice = Config.instance(agentAlice, dna)
const scenario = new Scenario([instanceAlice])

scenario.runTape(&quot;description of example test&quot;, async (t, { alice }) =&gt; {
  // Make a call to a Zome function
  // indicating the function, and passing it an input
  const addr = alice.call(&quot;my_zome&quot;, &quot;create_my_entry&quot;, {&quot;entry&quot; : {&quot;content&quot;:&quot;sample content&quot;}})
  const result = alice.call(&quot;my_zome&quot;, &quot;get_my_entry&quot;, {&quot;address&quot;: addr.Ok})

  // check for equality of the actual and expected results
  t.deepEqual(result, { Ok: { App: [ 'my_entry', '{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;sample content&quot;}' ] } })
})
</code></pre>
<p>This illustrates the <code>app.call</code> function that is exposed by the conductor for each app and that can be used to call our functions. Take note that the input-data should be a JSON object that matches the function signature. <code>call</code> will also return a JSON object.</p>

<p>Running <code>hc test</code> will build the test file and run it using <code>node</code> which is able to load and execute holochain hApps via the holochain node conductor. If everything has worked correctly you should see some test output with everything passing.</p>

<a class="header" href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>
<p>And there we have it! A simple Zome created with Holochain using the Rust HDK.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/willemolding/holochain-rust-todo">complete working version of this project is available on github</a>. This builds under the 0.0.9-alpha release but as the API and HDK are changing it will likely fail under newer releases.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-a-zome" id="adding-a-zome"><h1>Adding a Zome</h1></a>
<p>After <a href="../new_project.html">creating a new project</a>, in the resulting folder there is an empty folder called 'zomes'. The name of this folder is important and should not be changed. It will serve as the root folder for the one or more Zomes in a project.</p>
<p>Every Zome should have its own folder within the 'zomes' root folder, and the name of those folders is also important, it should be the name of the Zome. It shouldn't have any spaces, and it should be a valid folder name.</p>
<p>While you could go about creating a new Zome manually through your file system, it will be far faster to use the Holochain command line tools to generate one, with all the basic files you need included.</p>
<p>To do this, navigate in a command line to the root directory of your hApp project. In the command line, run</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc generate zomes/your_zome_name
</code></pre>
<p><code>hc</code> specifies that you wish to use the Holochain command line tools. <code>generate</code> specifies to use the command for initializing a new Zome. <code>zomes/your_zome_name</code> is an argument you supply as the path to, and the name of the Zome to generate.</p>
<p>The output should be as follows</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo init --lib --vcs none
Created library package
Generated new rust Zome at &quot;zomes/your_zome_name&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the case of a Rust Zome, which is the only language for a Zome we can generate at the moment, it will rely internally on Rust related commands (<code>cargo init</code>), meaning that Rust (and its package manager, cargo) must already ALSO be installed for this command to work successfully.</p>
<p>This has created a new folder (<code>zomes/your_zome_name</code>) in which you have the beginnings of a Zome.</p>
<a class="header" href="#whats-in-a-zome" id="whats-in-a-zome"><h2>What's in a Zome?</h2></a>
<p>A Rust based Zome folder looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>code
<ul>
<li>src
<ul>
<li>lib.rs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>.hcbuild</li>
<li>Cargo.toml</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zome.json</li>
</ul>
<p><code>code</code> is a folder that should always exist in a Zome, and should contain either pre-compiled WASM, or the source code and instructions to generate WASM. Everything within <code>code</code> is contextual to the language the Zome is written in, in the case above, a Rust &quot;crate&quot;. Files within <code>code</code> will be explained in detail below.</p>
<p><code>zome.json</code> is the top level configuration of your Zome.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rust-crate-zomes" id="rust-crate-zomes"><h3>Rust crate Zomes</h3></a>
<p>As mentioned above, the files within <code>code</code> are contextual to the language the Zome is written in, and in this case, that's Rust.</p>
<p>As developers tend to do, Rust developers gave their own unique name to Rust projects: &quot;crates&quot;. There are two types of Rust crates: <code>library</code> and <code>binary</code>. Since Zome code is getting compiled to WebAssembly, not standard binary executables, Zome crates use the <code>library</code> style, which is why we see under <code>code/src</code> a <code>lib.rs</code> file.</p>
<p>The most minimalistic library crate would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>src
<ul>
<li>lib.rs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cargo.toml</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the Zome we generated has one extra file, <code>.hcbuild</code>. This is the only Holochain specific file in the <code>code</code> folder. The rest is standard Rust. The <a href="../build_files.html"><code>.hcbuild</code> file is discussed</a> in another chapter.</p>
<p>In general, the generated files have been modified from their defaults to offer basic boilerplate needed to get started writing Zome code.</p>
<p><code>src/lib.rs</code> is the default entry point to the code of a library crate. It can be the one and only Rust file of a Zome, or it can use standard Rust imports from other Rust files and their exports, taking full advantage of the Rust module system natively.</p>
<p><code>Cargo.toml</code> is Rust's equivalent to nodejs' <code>package.json</code> or Ruby's <code>Gemfile</code>: a configuration and dependency specification at the same time.</p>
<p>Note that with the Cargo dependency system, Zome developers can take advantage of pre-existing Rust crates in their code, with one condition: that those dependencies are compatible when compiling to WebAssembly. This will be gone into in more detail elsewhere.</p>
<a class="header" href="#intro-to-language-hdks" id="intro-to-language-hdks"><h1>Intro to Language HDKs</h1></a>
<p>Within any Zome, there are a number of conventions that must be followed by the WASM code, in order to work with Holochain core. For example parameters are passed using a specific memory allocation scheme that needs to be followed to access the parameters that a Zome function receives.  Although it would be possible for Zome authors to code directly to the Holochain core API, it makes more sense to provide a software library for each language to make it as easy as possible to use those standard functions and behaviours. We call such a library a &quot;Holochain Development Kit&quot;, or HDK.</p>
<p>So in order to get familiar with coding for Holochain, it will involve familiarity with an HDK library.</p>
<p>An HDK performs many important functions for developers.</p>
<ul>
<li>It aids with the memory management of the WASM code that your Zomes compile into. WASM has some strict memory limitations, like 64 KiB paged memory.</li>
<li>It creates helper functions that hide tedious semantics that seem to plague compilation of languages to WASM.</li>
<li>It implements a complete type system that's compatible with Holochain.</li>
<li>It addresses hidden functions that Holochain needs from Zome code, but that would be redundant and confusing to make Zome developers write again and again.</li>
</ul>
<p>The HDK for a given language, if it has deep integration into the build tools, such as the Zome generator, should include this helper library by default, which is the case of the Rust HDK.</p>
<p>There is an in-depth article on <a href="../writing_development_kit.html">writing an HDK</a> if this sounds interesting to you.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-rust-hdk" id="the-rust-hdk"><h3>The Rust HDK</h3></a>
<p>The HDK with priority development and support is implemented in Rust, and is included right in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust">core repository</a> along with the Holochain core framework. Other HDKs may be implemented in different languages, and exist in separate repositories. This HDK implements all of the above features for developers, so just know that as you develop your Zome, a lot is going on behind the scenes in the HDK to make it all work.</p>
<p>The Rust HDK has documentation for each released version, available at <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/api/">developer.holochain.org/api</a>. This documentation will be invaluable during your use of the HDK, because it can show you how the definitions of the various custom Holochain types, and give examples and details on the use of the API functions exposed to the Zomes.</p>
<p>Notice that in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file of a new Zome, the HDK is included. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">...
[dependencies]
...
hdk = { git = &quot;https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust&quot;, branch = &quot;master&quot; }
...
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#setting-the-version-of-the-hdk" id="setting-the-version-of-the-hdk"><h4>Setting the version of the HDK</h4></a>
<p>Once Holochain stabilizes beyond the 0.0.x version numbers, it will be published to the Rust package manager, <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> and versioning will be simplified. For now, Cargo installs the HDK specified as a GIT dependency, fetching it from the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories">specified commit, branch, or tag of the repository</a>.</p>
<p>If you wanted to lock the HDK at a specific version, you could adjust the HDK dependency like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">hdk = { git = &quot;https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust&quot;, tag = &quot;v0.0.18-alpha1&quot; }
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#use-of-the-hdk-in-rust-code" id="use-of-the-hdk-in-rust-code"><h4>Use of the HDK in Rust code</h4></a>
<p>Notice now that within the <code>src/lib.rs</code> file of a new Zome, the HDK is already imported here too:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[macro_use]
extern crate hdk;
...
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>#[macro_use]</code> statement on the first line is very important, since it allows the usage of Rust macros (discussed in the <a href="./define_zome.html">Define Zome article</a>) defined in the HDK to be used in your code, and the macros will be needed. Now, within the Rust code files, exposed constants, functions, and even special macros from the HDK can be used.</p>
<p>The very first thing to familiarize with is the <code>define_zome!</code> macro. Read on to learn about it.</p>
<a class="header" href="#intro-to-zome-definition" id="intro-to-zome-definition"><h1>Intro to Zome Definition</h1></a>
<p>The <a href="./adding_a_zome.html">adding a zome</a> section explored the file structure of a Zome. <a href="./intro_to_hdk.html">Intro to HDK</a> covered Holochain Development Kit libraries for languages that Zomes can be written in. Once a Zome has been generated, and the HDK imported, it is time to start adding definitions to it.</p>
<p>There are multiple aspects to defining a Zome. They will each be covered in detail in the following articles.</p>
<p>What are the characteristics of a Zome, that need defining?</p>
<p>A Zome has</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: the name of the containing folder</li>
<li><code>description</code>: defined in JSON in the <code>zome.json</code> file within a Zome folder</li>
<li><code>config</code>: Not Implemented Yet</li>
<li>validating entry types: definition may vary based on the language</li>
<li>a <code>init</code> function: a callback that Holochain expects and requires, defined in the code itself</li>
<li><code>fn_declarations</code>: a collection of custom functions declarations,</li>
<li><code>traits</code>: sets of named function groups used for composability</li>
<li><code>code</code>: the core application logic of a Zome, written in a language that compiles to WASM, which Holochain interprets through that compiled WASM</li>
</ul>
<p>To develop a Zome, you will have to become familiar with these different aspects, the most complex of which are the validating entry types, and the traits and function definition. Implementation details will differ depending on the language that you are developing a Zome in.</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-in-rust-define_zome" id="building-in-rust-define_zome"><h2>Building in Rust: define_zome!</h2></a>
<p>As discussed in the <a href="./intro_to_hdk.html">intro to HDK</a> article, by setting the HDK as a dependency in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, and then referencing it in <code>src/lib.rs</code>, Zome code in Rust gains access to a host of features.</p>
<p>The first line in the following code snippet (from a <code>src/lib.rs</code>) is important: <code>#[macro_use]</code>. This imports access to custom Rust macros defined by the HDK.</p>
<p>What are Rust macros? Generally speaking, they are code that will actually generate other code, when compiled. They are shortcuts. Anywhere in Rust that you see an expression followed immediately (no space) by an exclamation mark (!) that is the use of a macro.</p>
<p>In the case of Zome development, it was discovered that much code could be saved from being written, by encapsulating it in a macro.</p>
<p>That is how <code>define_zome!</code> came about. It is a Rust macro imported from the HDK which must be used for every Zome (unless you read the source code for it yourself and write something that behaves the same way!)</p>
<p>The following is technically the most minimalistic Zome that could be implemented. It does nothing, but still conforms to the expectations Holochain has for a Zome.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[macro_use]
extern crate hdk;

define_zome! {
    entries: []

    init: || {
        Ok(())
    }

    validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }

    functions: []
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>entries</code> represents the validating entry type definitions. Note that it is an array, because there can be many. What validating entry types are will be <a href="./entry_type_definitions.html">explained next</a>.</p>
<p><code>init</code> represents the previously mentioned <code>init</code> callback that Holochain expects from every Zome. <a href="./init.html">Skip here for details.</a></p>
<p><code>functions</code> is where the functions are defined. <a href="./zome_functions.html">Skip here for details.</a></p>
<p>These are the three <em>required</em> properties of <code>define_zome!</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#app-entry-type-definitions" id="app-entry-type-definitions"><h1>App Entry Type Definitions</h1></a>
<p>An &quot;entry&quot; is a data element that an agent authors to their source-chain (stored on their local device), which is then propagated to peers. The entry is backed by a &quot;chain header&quot;, which is the data element used for verification of the integrity of itself, as well as the entry.</p>
<p>Entries are a fundamental, primitive type within Holochain. Entries are an abstraction, they can technically be persisted to a device in a variety of ways, using a variety of databases, which can be as simple as files in the file system.</p>
<p>There are types of entries which cannot be written to the chain by users of an application. These are generally called system entries. They include DNA, and initial Agent entries, which are always the first two entries written to a chain.</p>
<p>There are a special type of entries called App Entries. These are entries which are created through the active use of an application by a user. They must have an entry type which, rather than being system defined, is defined by the Zome developer.</p>
<a class="header" href="#defining-app-entry-types" id="defining-app-entry-types"><h2>Defining App Entry Types</h2></a>
<p>Creating a Zome for a hApp will almost always involve defining app entry types for that Zome. This means looking closely at the data model.</p>
<p>What types of data will the Zome be designed to handle? Is it dealing in &quot;users&quot;, &quot;transactions&quot;, &quot;friendships&quot;, &quot;tasks&quot;, or what? These will be the entry types needing definition in a Zome.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, when defining the entry type, the developer of a Zome is designing the behaviour and generic properties of data of that type. This includes these important aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>how that data is shared, or not, with peers</li>
<li>the schema for entries of the type</li>
<li>custom validation behaviour for entries of the type</li>
<li>types of relationships (links) that can exist between entry types</li>
</ul>
<p>An entry type is given a name that is used when an agent is attempting to write an entry to the chain. That's how Holochain knows what to do with the data for the entry that it has been given.</p>
<p>An entry type should also be given a basic description so that other people reading it understand the use of the entry type.</p>
<p>A third important property is <code>sharing</code>. The primary options for this at this time are 'Private' and 'Public'. Private means entries of this type will stay only the device of the author. Public means entries of this type will be gossiped to other peers sharing copies of the DNA. Public does NOT mean that it will be shared publicly on the internet.</p>
<p>Examining a <code>.dna.json</code> file closely, nested within the JSON configuration for a Zome, for an entry type you might see something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;entry_types&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;entry_type_name&quot;: &quot;post&quot;,
        &quot;properties&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;description\&quot;: \&quot;A blog post entry which has an author\&quot;}&quot;,
        &quot;sharing&quot;: &quot;public&quot;,
        &quot;links_to&quot;: []
    }
]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a Zome that implements only a single entry type, <code>post</code>.</p>
<p>These values are likely not to be modified within a JSON file, but within some code itself, where the entry type is defined. The validation rules for the entry type, will of course be defined within the code as well. Since this can be a complex topic, defining the validation logic has <a href="./entry_validation.html">its' own article</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up the entry types for a Zome is an often logical starting point when creating a Zome.</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-in-rust-defining-an-entry-type" id="building-in-rust-defining-an-entry-type"><h2>Building in Rust: Defining an Entry Type</h2></a>
<p>Recall that in <a href="./define_zome.html#building-in-rust-define_zome">define_zome!</a>, there was an array called <code>entries</code>. The most minimalistic Zome could look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[macro_use]
extern crate hdk;

define_zome! {
    entries: []

    init: || {
        Ok(())
    }

    validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }

    functions: []

    traits: {}
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>entries</code> is where we will populate the Zome with entry type definitions. It expects an array of <code>ValidatingEntryType</code>. So how can one be created?</p>
<p>Easy: the <code>entry!</code> macro. It can be used to encapsulate everything needed to define an entry type. All of the following must be defined:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>name</strong></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
entry!(
    name: &quot;post&quot;,
    ...
)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This should be a machine-readable name for the entry type. Spaces should not be used. What will the entry type be that will be given when new entries are being created?</p>

<p>Historically this was a human-readable explanation of the meaning or role of this entry type. Now the description field can hold a stringified JSON object to hold various properties of this entry type (Possibly including a description but also UI display hints, indexing fields, example data etc. It is totally up to you). These properties can be accessed via <code>hdk::entry_type_properties</code>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, sharing refers to whether entries of this type are private to their author, or whether they will be gossiped to other peers to hold copies of. The value must be referenced from an <a href="/api/0.0.26-alpha1/holochain_core_types/dna/entry_types/enum.Sharing.html">enum in the HDK</a>.

<p>Clearly, <code>native_type</code> is where things start to get interesting. It requires the introduction of quite a number of dependencies, first of all. Why is that?</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the Rust code of a Zome is compiled into WASM before it can be executed by Holochain. This introduces a certain constraint. How is data passed between Holochain, and the WASM Zome code? Answer: it is stored in the WASM memory as stringified JSON data, and accessed by the WASM code and by Holochain, running the WASM interpreter.</p>
<p>JSON was chosen as the interchange format because it is so universal, and almost all languages have serializers and parsers. Rust's is called <code>serde</code>. The three <code>serde</code> related dependencies all relate to the need to serialize to and from JSON within Zomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the HDK offers built-in conversion functions from JSON strings to Entry structs. This comes from the <code>DefaultJson</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/derive.html">derive</a>.</p>
<p>Every struct used as a <code>native_type</code> reference should include all 4 derives, as in the example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, DefaultJson)]
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code> come from <code>serde_derive</code>, and <code>DefaultJson</code> comes from <code>holochain_persistence_derive</code>.</p>
<p>Then there is the struct itself. This is the real type definition, because it defines the schema. It is simply a list of property names, the 'keys', and the types of values expected, which should be set to one of the primitive types of the language. This will tell <code>serde</code> how to parse JSON string inputs into the type. Note that conversion from JSON strings into the struct type can easily fail, in particular if the proper keys are not present on the input.</p>

<p><strong>validation_package</strong></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

    validation_package: || {
        ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry
    },
    ...
)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>At the moment, what <code>validation_package</code> is will not be covered in great detail. In short, for a peer to perform validation of an entry from another peer, varying degrees of metadata from the original author of the entry might be needed. <code>validation_package</code> refers to the carrier for that extra metadata.</p>
<p>Looking at the above code, there is a required import from the HDK needed for use in <code>validation_package</code>, and that's the enum <code>ValidationPackageDefinition</code>. The value of <code>validation_package</code> is a function that takes no arguments. It will be called as a callback by Holochain. The result should be a value from the <code>ValidationPackageDefinition</code> enum, whose values can be <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/api/0.0.26-alpha1/hdk/enum.ValidationPackageDefinition.html">seen here</a>. In the example, and as the most basic option, simply use <code>Entry</code>, which means no extra metadata beyond the entry itself is needed.</p>

<p><strong>validation</strong></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use hdk::EntryValidationData;

entry!(
    ...
    validation: |_validation_data: ValidationData&lt;Post&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }
)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>validation</code> is the last required property of <code>entry!</code>. Because it is such an important aspect, it has <a href="./entry_validation.html">its' own in depth article</a>.</p>
<p>It is a callback that Holochain will call during different moments in the lifecycle of an entry, in order to confirm which action to take with the entry, depending on its' validity. It will be called with two arguments, the first representing the struct of the entry itself, and the second a struct holding extra metadata that can be used for validation, including, if it was requested, the <code>validation_package</code>.</p>
<p>The callback should return a Rust <code>Result</code> type. This is seen in <code>Ok(())</code>. The example above is the simplest possible <code>validation</code> function, since it doesn't perform any real logic. While this is ok in theory, great caution should be taken with the validation rules, and further reading is recommended.</p>
<p><code>validation</code> for a <code>ValidatingEntryType</code> should either return <code>Ok(())</code> or an <code>Err</code> containing the string explaining why validation failed.</p>
<p>The validity of an entry is therefore defined by the author of a Zome. First of all, data which doesn't conform to the schema defined by the <code>native_type</code> will fail, but <code>validation</code> allows for further rules to be defined.</p>
<p>Note that not only the entry author will call this function to validate the entry during its' creation, but other peers will call this function to validate the entry when it is requested via the network that they hold a copy of it. <em>This is at the heart of how Holochain functions as peer-to-peer data integrity layer.</em></p>

<a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together" id="putting-it-all-together"><h3>Putting It All Together</h3></a>
<p>Taken all together, use of the <code>entry!</code> macro may look something like the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
...
entry!(
    name: &quot;post&quot;,
    description: &quot;A blog post entry which has an author&quot;,
    sharing: Sharing::Public,
    validation_package: || {
        ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry
    },
    validation: |validation_data: EntryValidationData&lt;Post&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }
)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This can be embedded directly inside of the entries array of the <code>define_zome!</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
...
define_zome! {
    entries: [
        entry!(

                Ok(())
            }
        )
    ]

    init: || {
        Ok(())
    }

    validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }

    functions: []

    capabilitites: {}
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If there is only entry type, this can be fine, but if there are multiple, this can hurt readability of the source code. You can wrap the entry type definition in a function, and call it in <code>define_zome!</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
...
fn post_definition() -&gt; ValidatingEntryType {
    entry!(
        name: &quot;post&quot;,
        description: &quot;A blog post entry which has an author&quot;,
        sharing: Sharing::Public,

        validation_package: || {
            hdk::ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry
        },

        validation: |_validation_data: Validation&lt;Post&gt;| {
            Ok(())
        }
    )
}

define_zome! {
    entries: [
        post_definition()
    ]

    init: || {
        Ok(())
    }

<p>Use of this technique can help you write clean, modular code.</p>
<pre><code>If you want to look closely at a complete example of the use of `entry!` in a Zome, check out the [API reference](https://developer.holochain.org/api/0.0.26-alpha1/hdk/macro.entry.html), or the [&quot;app-spec&quot; example app](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/blob/release-0.0.26-alpha1/app_spec/zomes/blog/code/src/post.rs).

<a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary"><h4>Summary</h4></a>
<p>This is still a pretty minimal Zome, since it doesn't have any functions yet, and the most basic <code>init</code> behaviour, so read on to learn about how to work with those aspects of <code>define_zome!</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#init" id="init"><h1>Init</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#the-initialization-process" id="the-initialization-process"><h2>The Initialization Process</h2></a>
<p>Recall that every peer will be running instances of DNA on their device. This is how peers join the network for a given DNA. There are some actions that a developer may wish to initiate, upon a new peer joining a network. For this reason, a hook into this moment of the lifecycle is implemented by Holochain. It also provides an opportunity to reject the user from joining, if for some reason there is an issue with the way they are attempting to.</p>
<p>This lifecycle stage is called <code>init</code>. It is a callback that Holochain expects every single Zome to implement, because it will call it during initialization. If it does not exist within the WASM code for a Zome it will cause an error and peers will not be able to launch an instance of the DNA.</p>
<p>This function also has the opportunity to reject the success of the launch of the instance. If it succeeds, the expected return value is just an integer (in WASM) representing that, but if it fails, a string is expected to be passed, explaining why.</p>
<p>When Holochain is attempting to launch an instance of a Zome, it will iterate through all the Zomes one by one, calling <code>init</code> within each. If each succeeds, success. If any one fails, the launch will fail, and the error string will be returned to the peer.</p>
<p>Holochain will wait up to 30 seconds for a <code>init</code> response from the Zome, before it will throw a timeout error.</p>
<p>Of course, this also indicates that <code>init</code> is a reserved function name and should not be used as the name of any other function that is publicly callable in the Zome.</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-in-rust-init" id="building-in-rust-init"><h2>Building in Rust: init</h2></a>
<p>How is <code>init</code> used within the Rust HDK?</p>
<p><a href="./define_zome.html">Previously</a>, the general structure of <code>define_zome!</code> has been covered. It includes a Rust function closure called <code>init</code>, which is passed zero arguments. This is the hook that Holochain is expecting. It expects a Rust <code>Result</code> as a return value, which is either <code>Ok(())</code> or an <code>Err</code>, with the string explaining the error.</p>
<p>In the following two examples, nothing interesting will happen in the <code>init</code> functions, they are simply to illustrate how to return success, and how to return failure.</p>
<p>More complex capabilities will be possible during <code>init</code> in the future, yet for now, using the first simple example that succeeds is recommended.</p>
<p>If <code>init</code> should succeed:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
define_zome! {
    entries: []

    init: || {
        Ok(())
    }

    validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }

    functions: []

    traits: {}
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If <code>init</code> should fail:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
define_zome! {
    entries: []

    init: || {
        Err(&quot;the error string&quot;.to_string())
    }

    validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {

    }

    functions: []

    traits: {}
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#validate-agent" id="validate-agent"><h1>Validate Agent</h1></a>
<p>In Holochain the validation of the second entry on the chain, the AgentID, plays a important role because it serves as place to define membrane functions.  Therefore we have created a special validation function that must always be defined in every zome.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {{
    if let EntryValidationData::Create{entry, ..} = validation_data {
        let agent = entry as AgentId;
        if agent.nick == &quot;reject_agent::app&quot; {
            Err(&quot;This agent will always be rejected&quot;.into())
        } else {
            Ok(())
        }
    } else {
        Err(&quot;Cannot update or delete an agent at this time&quot;.into())
    }
}}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#zome-functions" id="zome-functions"><h1>Zome Functions</h1></a>
<p>It is time to address the core application logic of Zomes.</p>
<p>What Zome functions you write depends, of course, on what you are building your application to do. By exposing a number of native capacities of Holochain to Zomes, developers have been given access to a rich suite of tools that offer limitless ways they can be combined. Holochain achieves this by exposing core functions to the WASM code of Zomes.</p>
<p>A core feature of an HDK is that it will handle that native interface to Holochain, wrapping the underlying functions in easy to call, well defined and well documented functions that are native to the language that you're writing in!</p>
<p>So within Zome code, by calling functions of the HDK, you can do powerful things with Holochain, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read and write data to and from the configured storage mechanism, and from the network</li>
<li>Transport messages directly between nodes of a network</li>
<li>Call functions in other Zomes, and even &quot;bridged&quot; DNA instances</li>
<li>Use cryptographic functions like signing and verification to handle data security and integrity</li>
<li>Emit &quot;signals&quot; containing data from a Zome, to a UI for example</li>
</ul>
<p>How these different functions work and how to use them will be covered throughout the rest of this chapter in detail. This article will provide a general overview of what Zome functions themselves are and how they work.</p>
<p>Recall that Zomes will be written in diverse programming languages, any one that compiles to WebAssembly. Towards the bottom of this article, &quot;Building in Rust&quot; gives examples of what writing functions in Rust will be like. It is difficult to show what a function in WASM looks like, since even the &quot;human-readable&quot; version of WASM, WAT, is not highly readable.</p>
<a class="header" href="#dna-zomes-functions-traits-and-capabilities" id="dna-zomes-functions-traits-and-capabilities"><h2>DNA, Zomes, Functions, Traits, and Capabilities</h2></a>
<p>When Holochain loads a DNA file, to start an instance from it, it expects the presence of one or more Zomes in the definition. Here is a skeletal (incomplete) DNA JSON file to illustrate this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;test&quot;,
    &quot;zomes&quot;: {
        &quot;test_zome&quot;: {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;test_zome&quot;,
            &quot;traits&quot;: {
                &quot;hc_public&quot;: {
                    &quot;functions&quot;: [],
                }
            },
            &quot;fn_declarations&quot;: [],
            &quot;code&quot;: {
                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;AAECAw==&quot;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This theoretical DNA has one Zome, &quot;test_zome&quot;. However, it has no functions. Note that the nested <code>fn_declarations</code> property is an empty array.</p>
<p>There are a few things to learn from this DNA JSON. The first, is that the code, Base64 encoded WASM, is actually embedded in the Zome's definition, nested under <code>code.code</code>. All the functions Holochain expects to be implemented need to be encapsulated within that WASM code.</p>
<p>The second is that even outside of the WASM code, Holochain expects a certain level of visibility into the functions contained within, at least the ones meant to be called via Holochain (as oppose to private/internal functions).</p>
<p>There are at least two reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be able to reason about data inputs and outputs for those functions</li>
<li>to group those functions semantically for composition</li>
</ul>
<p>These will both be discussed below.</p>
<a class="header" href="#function-declarations" id="function-declarations"><h2>Function Declarations</h2></a>
<p>All of the Zome's functions are declared in the <code>fn_declarations</code> array. Here is an example of one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;fn_declarations&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;get_task_list&quot;,
        &quot;inputs&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;username&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;}],
        &quot;outputs&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;task_list&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;json&quot;}]
    }
]
</code></pre>
<p>Each function declaration is an object that includes the <code>name</code>, and the <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code> expected for the function. Since WebAssembly only compiles from code languages with a type system, the generation of these inputs and outputs can expected to be automated.</p>
<p>The <code>name</code> is the most important thing here, because when a function call to an instance is being performed, it will have to match a name which Holochain can find in the <code>functions</code>. If the function isn't declared, Holochain will treat it as if it doesn't exist, even if it is an exposed function in the WASM code.</p>
<a class="header" href="#traits" id="traits"><h2>Traits</h2></a>
<p>Traits provide a way to group functions by name.  The primary use of this feature is for creating a composibility space where DNA creators can implement different DNAs to emergent function interfaces and then compose with them in the conductor by matching on the function group names and signatures.  Additionally Holochain may reserve a few special trait names that have specific side-effects.  The first of such reserved names is <code>hc_public</code>.  Functions grouped in this name will have automatically added to a public capability grant that happens at init time, thus making them accessible to any caller.  For more details on the Holochain security model please see the <a href="capabilities.html">Capabilities</a> section.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what a trait definition using the public reserved trait name might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;traits&quot;: {
    &quot;hc_public&quot;: {
        &quot;functions&quot;: [&quot;get_task_list&quot;]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#data-interchange---inputs-and-outputs" id="data-interchange---inputs-and-outputs"><h2>Data Interchange - Inputs and Outputs</h2></a>
<p>In order to support building zomes in a variety of languages, we decided to use a simple language agnostic function specification format, using JSON.  Other formats may be supported in the future.</p>
<p>This has two big implications: Holochain Conductor implementations must handle JSON serialization and deserialization on the &quot;outside&quot;, and HDKs and Zomes must handle JSON serialization and deserialization on the &quot;inside&quot;. Holochain agrees only to mediate between the two by passing a string (which should represent valid JSON data).</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-zome-functions-are-called" id="how-zome-functions-are-called"><h2>How Zome Functions Are Called</h2></a>
<p>Function calls are received by Holochain from client requests (which there are a variety of implementations of, discussed later).  When function calls are being made, they will need to include a complete enough set of arguments to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>which Zome?</li>
<li>which function?</li>
<li>what values should the function be called with?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before making the function call, Holochain will check the validity of the request, and fail if necessary. If the request is deemed valid, Holochain will mount the WASM code for a Zome using its' WASM interpreter, and then make a function call into it, giving it the arguments given to it in the request. When it receives the response from the WASM, it will then pass that return value as the response to the request. This may sound complex, but that's just what's going on internally, actually using it with an HDK and a <a href="../conductors.html">Conductor</a> (which is discussed later) is easy.</p>

<p>So far, in <a href="./entry_type_definitions.html">entry type definitions</a> and <a href="./init.html">init</a>, the most complex example of <code>define_zome!</code> was still very simple, and didn't include any functions:</p>

<p>In this example, <code>hc_public</code> is the reserved trait name which creates a <code>Public</code> Capbility-type grant at init time for access to the <code>read_post</code> function.

<a class="header" href="#adding-a-zome-function" id="adding-a-zome-function"><h3>Adding a Zome Function</h3></a>
<p>In order to add a Zome function, there are two primary steps that are involved.</p>
<ol>
<li>declare your function in <code>define_zome!</code></li>
<li>write the Rust code for the handler of that function, calling any HDK functions you need</li>
</ol>

<p>In this example, <code>send_message</code> is the given name of this function, by which it will be referenced and called elsewhere. There are three properties necessary to provide <code>send_message</code>, and any function declaration: <code>inputs</code>, <code>outputs</code>, and <code>handler</code>.</p>
<p><code>inputs</code> expects a list or argument names, and types, for the <code>send_message</code> function to be called with.</p>
<p><code>outputs</code> expects a single declaration of a return type. The name (which in the example is <code>response</code>) is arbitrary, call it anything.</p>
<p><code>handler</code> expects the name of a function which will handle this function call, and which matches the function signature of <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code>. In this case, <code>handle_send_message</code>, which has yet to be defined.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>Here is an example of a simplistic function, for illustration purposes. It centers on the use of a function call to an HDK function.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn handle_send_message(to_agent: Address, message: String) -&gt; ZomeApiResult&lt;String&gt;  {
    hdk::send(to_agent, message, 60000.into())
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notice right away how the arguments match perfectly with the <code>inputs: |...|</code> section of the function declaration. Any differences will cause issues. This is also true of the return type of the output. Note the pairing of <code>ZomeApiResult&lt;String&gt;</code> as the return type.</p>
<p>The name of the function, <code>handle_send_message</code> is the same as the name given as the <code>handler</code> in the <code>define_zome!</code> function declaration.</p>
<p>Within the function, <code>handle_send_message</code> makes use of a Holochain/HDK function that <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/api/0.0.26-alpha1/hdk/api/fn.send.html">sends messages directly node-to-node</a>.</p>
<p>The available functions, their purpose, and how to use them is fully documented elsewhere, in the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/api/0.0.26-alpha1/hdk/api/index.html#functions">API reference</a> and the <a href="./api_functions.html">List of API Functions</a>.</p>
<p>In the example, <code>handle_send_message</code> simply forwards the result of calling <code>hdk::send</code> as its' own result.</p>
<p>Here are the above two steps combined:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
...

fn handle_send_message(to_agent: Address, message: String) -&gt; ZomeApiResult&lt;String&gt;  {
    hdk::send(to_agent, message, 60000.into())
}

define_zome! {
    ...
    functions: [
        send_message: {
            inputs: |to_agent: Address, message: String|,
            outputs: |response: ZomeApiResult&lt;String&gt;|,
            handler: handle_send_message
        }
    ]
}
#}</code></pre></pre>

<a class="header" href="#capabilities" id="capabilities"><h1>Capabilities</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#overview-1" id="overview-1"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>Holochain uses a modified version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities</a> security model.  Holochain DNA instances will grant revokable, cryptographic capability tokens which are shared as access credentials. Appropriate access credentials must be used to access functions and private data.</p>
<p>This enables us to use a single security pattern for:</p>
<ul>
<li>connecting end-user UIs,</li>
<li>calls across zomes within a DNA,</li>
<li>bridging calls between different DNAs,</li>
<li>and providing selective users of a DNA the ability to query private entries on the local chain via send/receive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each capability grant gets recorded as a private entry on the grantor’s chain.  The hash (i.e. address) of that entry is then serves as the capability token usable by the grantee when making zome function call, because the grantor simply verifies the existence of that grant in it's chain.  Thus, all zome functions calls include a capability request object which contains: public key of the grantee and signature of the parameters being used to call the function, along with the capability token being used as the access credential.</p>
<a class="header" href="#using-capabilities" id="using-capabilities"><h2>Using Capabilities</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#public-capabilities" id="public-capabilities"><h3>Public Capabilities</h3></a>
<p>You can declare some functions as &quot;public&quot;  using the special <code>hc_public</code> marker trait in your <code>define_zome!</code> call.  Functions in that trait will be added to the public capability grant which gets auto-committed during init.  Like this:</p>
<pre><code>define_zome! {

...

   traits: {
       hc_public [read_post, write_post]
   }

...

}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#grant-capabilities" id="grant-capabilities"><h3>Grant Capabilities</h3></a>
<p>You can use the <code>commit_capability_grant</code> HDK function to create a custom capability grant.  For example, imaging a blogging use-case where you want to grant friends the ability to call the <code>create_post</code> function in a <code>blog</code> zome.  Assuming the function <code>is_my_friend(addr)</code> correctly examines the provenance in CAPABILITY_REQ global which always holds the capability request of the current zome call, then the following code is an example of how you might call <code>hdk::commit_capability_grant</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn handle_request_post_grant() -&gt; ZomeApiResult&lt;Option&lt;Address&gt;&gt; {
    let addr = CAPABILITY_REQ.provenance.source();
    if is_my_friend(addr.clone()) {
        let mut functions = BTreeMap::new();
        functions.insert(&quot;blog&quot;.to_string(), vec![&quot;create_post&quot;.to_string()]);
        Ok(Some(hdk::commit_capability_grant(
            &quot;can_post&quot;,
            CapabilityType::Assigned,
            Some(vec![addr]),
            functions,
        )?))
    } else {
        Ok(None)
    }

<a class="header" href="#the-local-source-chain-headers-and-entries" id="the-local-source-chain-headers-and-entries"><h2>The Local Source Chain: Headers and Entries</h2></a>
<p>At the core of how Holochain is designed is the &quot;local source chain&quot;.
It is the data structure that puts Holochain in the family of &quot;distributed ledger technology&quot;.
It functions as an &quot;append-only log&quot;, which is a fancy way of saying that data can only ever be written to the log,
and never modified in place, nor removed, without breaking the integrity of the data that follows it in the log. As has been found for many other projects, this is a critical design choice for a distributed technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that across the world of crytocurrency and distributed ledgers, these logs are sometimes given different names, despite usually refering to a very similar data structure: feed, log, ledger, and chain are only four such examples. What they share is the append-only nature, as well as the use of cryptographic signatures for securing data integrity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a consequence of this log-like data structure, Holochain is a departure from traditional relational
(SQL) and also non-relational (noSQL) databases. There are no tables, and no foreign keys, at least on the formal level of Holochain.
Despite this, one must of course still be able to persist data, and read back persisted data, and all of that happens in relation to the local source chain.</p>
<p>With Holochain, there are two aspects that combine to form each &quot;element&quot; in this chain-like log: headers, and entries.</p>
<a class="header" href="#headers" id="headers"><h3>Headers</h3></a>
<p>The fundamental chain-like aspect of Holochain is driven by &quot;headers&quot;. They are a minimal data structure containing only a handful of values, but are sufficient to supply Holochain with verifiable data integrity.</p>
<p>Fundamental to creating the &quot;chain&quot;, each header contains a reference to the &quot;last&quot; header. There are a couple aspects to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cryptographic hash (its data &quot;fingerprint&quot;) for a header is determined</li>
<li>The hash of the previously written header is used as a fixed-length input for the next header, thus influencing the hash of that new header (since any change to contents change a hash)</li>
<li>The only time this does not apply is for the very first header, for which there is no previous header hash, and a value of <code>0</code> is used</li>
</ol>
<p>Other data contained in the headers includes (but isn't limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>the public key/address, and the cryptographically signed signature of the author</li>
<li>a timestamp conveying the moment of creation of the header, from the perspective of the author's system clock</li>
<li>the hash of the &quot;entry&quot; being created</li>
<li>the &quot;entry type&quot; of the &quot;entry&quot; being created</li>
</ul>
<p>The meaning and role of entries is covered next.</p>
<a class="header" href="#entries" id="entries"><h3>Entries</h3></a>
<p>Entries are elements of data which get persisted to the same storage as Headers, yet have a different nature. They represent the substance of the data that is of interest to the end users of Holochain, storing records such as transactions, social media posts, or whatever else app developers come up with. The hash of each entry is stored and referenced in its corresponding header. Every local source chain should have exactly one Entry for every Header.</p>
<p>All Entries have a type. Entries can be &quot;system&quot; Entries, or &quot;app&quot; Entries. System Entries are Entries integral to the proper functioning of Holochain. Importantly, there are system Entries written to each local source chain, at the time of its initialization.</p>
<a class="header" href="#system-entries" id="system-entries"><h4>System Entries</h4></a>
<p>These include firstly, the DNA itself. The DNA is written as the first entry into each local source chain. Importantly, this is the foundation for establishing confidence in the data of everyone's chains: the fact that you all know you started out by running the same code (otherwise, the hash of the initial DNA entry would be different). There will be more discussion on this later.</p>
<p>The second Entry to be written to the chain is information about the agent using this source chain. That includes their &quot;public key&quot; which is also their address on the network.</p>
<p>There are also other system entry types which are automatically created to record the occurrence of certain actions such as the creation or removal of a link, the marking of an existing entry as deleted, or the granting or revoking of a capability token. These will be covered in more detail in later chapters.</p>
<a class="header" href="#app-entries" id="app-entries"><h4>App Entries</h4></a>
<p>Next, there are the &quot;App&quot; Entries. The definitions for these entry types, and how to validate them, are in the hands of developers. When end users are attempting actions which should author data, the data will first be checked against the validation rules supplied by the DNA developer. The possibilities for App Entry type definitions are endless. Defining App Entry types is how you setup the schemas, data structures, and data integrity of your DNA.</p>
<a class="header" href="#entry-sharing" id="entry-sharing"><h4>Entry Sharing</h4></a>
<p>Not every Entry must be shared with other people running the same DNA. There are two (and may be more later) levels of sharing for App Entries defined: <code>public</code> and <code>private</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>public</code>, all Entries of that type will get propagated to the other peers running the same DNA, so that they will hold a copy as well, and make your data more resilient, and so that it is available even when you're offline.</p>
<p>With <code>private</code>, the Entry will never leave your device. In order to still be able to verify your local source chain, the HEADER for that Entry will be propagated to other peers, but the Entry itself will not.</p>
<a class="header" href="#data-propagation" id="data-propagation"><h2>Data Propagation</h2></a>
<p>After any chain-modifying functions are called, Holochain will attempt to notify other peers in the network of those actions. Note that it is not a requirement that the device be online or connected to any other networks or nodes for Holochain to be usable! Holochain will persist the changes locally to be gossiped to connected peers at a later date. As mentioned previously, if the entry is one of a <code>private</code> App Entry type, then only the Header will be published, not the entry itself. Publishing of the data is secondary to being able to author data in the first place, so this will be further elaborated in the <a href="./entry_validation.html">entry validation</a> article.</p>
<a class="header" href="#writing-data" id="writing-data"><h2>Writing Data</h2></a>
<p>Broadly speaking, writing data is accomplished by writing Zome source code that makes API calls to Holochain to affect the local source chain. One should only modify chain data by calling Holochain API functions, as there is lots of internal logic that it is instrumental that Holochain perform, for each change. When an API function to alter the chain from Zome source code is invoked, a series of steps is performed internally. It is important to know, at least roughly, what those steps are so that you can use Holochain effectively.</p>
<p>Apart from the following three functions, there is only one additional way that data can be written to the local source chain, which is written about in <a href="./linking.html">linking</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#creating-entries-or-committing" id="creating-entries-or-committing"><h3>Creating Entries, or &quot;Committing&quot;</h3></a>
<p>Of course, first and foremost, there is the simple action of writing a new Entry. This is actually known as &quot;committing&quot; an Entry. It is known as &quot;committing&quot; an Entry in Holochain for precisely the reason that once you write it, you can't &quot;unwrite&quot; it, or delete it, without corrupting the integrity of your local source chain. It is there for good, and can only be &quot;marked&quot; as updated or deleted by writing additional entries in the future.</p>
<p>Because the Entry will be permanent in your local source chain, it must first pass validation, in order to be written in the first place. Validation of Entries is core to the distributed data integrity model of Holochain.</p>
<p>Invoking the commit entry API function will not always return &quot;success&quot;. The call can fail if the Entry fails to pass validation, or something else goes wrong internally while Holochain is attempting to write the Entry to the local source chain. Like in any code, failure tolerant code is far better, and Zomes should be written to handle possible error cases.</p>
<p>So in general, the process that Holochain follows while trying to write an Entry during a &quot;commit&quot; call is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collects data necessary for use in validation (a &quot;validation package&quot;)</li>
<li>Checks whether the new entry is valid by passing it through the validation callback specified in the Zome for its given entry type. If this fails, it will exit here and return either a user defined, or system level error message</li>
<li>Creates a new Header for the Entry, and writes it to storage</li>
<li>Writes the Entry itself to storage</li>
<li>Announces over the network module this new Header and Entry, requesting that peers validate and hold a copy of it. This is known internally as &quot;publishing&quot;.</li>
<li>Returns the &quot;address&quot; of the new Entry, which is the crytographic hash of the Entry data combined with its entry type string. This address can be used later to retrieve the Entry.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#updating-entries" id="updating-entries"><h3>Updating Entries</h3></a>
<p>The act of updating an Entry is technically speaking just the same &quot;committing an Entry&quot;, plus storing a bit of metadata indicating that this new entry is an &quot;update&quot; to the entry at an old address which is also given. This has the effect that when an attempt to retrieve an Entry by its address, it will forward the request along to the latest version in a potential series of updates, and return that instead. There is always the option to return the results for an Entry according to whether it's the &quot;initial&quot; version, the &quot;latest&quot;, or getting the entire history too.</p>
<p>So to update an Entry, use the address of that entry, and provide the new Entry to replace it. You can use the address of the Entry at any point in its update history as the address to update (as long as it hasn't been marked deleted), and it will still work, technically updating the very latest version of that Entry instead of whatever you pass in.</p>
<p>So in general, the process that Holochain follows while trying to update an Entry during an &quot;update_entry&quot; call is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieves the very latest version of the Entry at the given address</li>
<li>Collects data necessary for use in validation (a &quot;validation package&quot;)</li>
<li>Checks whether the new entry is valid by passing it through the validation callback specified in the Zome for its given entry type. If this fails, it will exit here and return either a user defined, or system level error message</li>
<li>Creates a new Header for the Entry, and writes it to storage</li>
<li>Writes the Entry itself to storage</li>
<li>Announces over the network module this new Header and Entry, requesting that peers validate and hold a copy of it. This is known internally as &quot;publishing&quot;. <strong>This step also involves updating the metadata for the Entry at the old address such that default requests for it will forward to the new Entry.</strong></li>
<li>Returns the &quot;address&quot; of the new Entry, which is the crytographic hash of the Entry data combined with its entry type string. This address can be used later to retrieve the Entry.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#removing-entries" id="removing-entries"><h3>Removing Entries</h3></a>
<p>The goal of removing an Entry is so that it will not automatically show up as a result when attempts to retrieve it are made, it is NOT to delete it entirely. Removing an Entry will not prevent someone who wishes to retrieve it from retrieving it, they will just have to pass a special option to do so. This makes sense due to the &quot;append-only&quot; nature of Holochain: the original Entry is never gone.</p>
<p>To remove an Entry, Holochain actually commits an Entry of a special type: <code>DeletionEntry</code>.</p>
<p>So in general, the process that Holochain follows while trying to remove an Entry during an &quot;remove_entry&quot; call is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieves the very latest version of the Entry at the given address</li>
<li>Collects data necessary for use in validation (a &quot;validation package&quot;)</li>
<li>Creates a new <code>DeletionEntry</code>, containing the address of the very latest version of the given entry</li>
<li>Checks whether the <code>DeletionEntry</code> is valid by passing it through the validation callback specified in the Zome for its given entry type. If this fails, it will exit here and return either a user defined, or system level error message</li>
<li>Creates a new Header for the Entry, and writes it to storage</li>
<li>Writes the Entry itself to storage</li>
<li>Announces over the network module this new Header and Entry, requesting that peers validate and hold a copy of it. This is known internally as &quot;publishing&quot;. <strong>This step also involves updating the metadata for the Entry at the old address such that default requests for it will return no Entry.</strong></li>
<li>Returns a null value, as there is no need to retrieve the new <code>DeletionEntry</code> at any point for any reason.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#reading-data" id="reading-data"><h2>Reading Data</h2></a>
<p>Reading data is a lot more straightforward than writing data. Data is either read from your own device, if it lives there, or is fetched from peers over network connections. Throughout the writing data section, it was mentioned that Entries and even Headers have &quot;addresses&quot;. These addresses are linked to the content itself, following a pattern known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">&quot;content addressable storage&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>This means that to determine the address, the content is passed through a cryptographic hash function, which will deterministically give the same hash whenever the same content is given, and can take an input of any length, and return a result of fixed length. The content is then deposited in a location on a computer, and a network, where it can be retrieved given its address/hash.</p>
<p>Only Entries may be retrieved by their address, not Headers.</p>

<p>Holochain DNA instances are designed to function in the context of a <a href="./dpki.html">Distributed Public Key Insfrastructure (DPKI)</a> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>manages key creation and revocation</li>
<li>manages an agency context that allows grouping and verifying that sets of DNA instances are controlled by the same agent.</li>
<li>creates a context for identity verification</li>
</ol>
<p>Holochain assumes that there may be different DPKI implementations but provides a reference implementation we call DeepKey.   We assume that the DPKI implementation is itself a Holochain application, and we provide access to a set of generic cryptographic functions.  These functions also allow DNA authors to build ad-hoc cryptogrpahic protocols.</p>
<p>For each Holochain DNA instance, the conductor maintains a Keystore, which holds &quot;secrets&quot; (seeds and keys) needed for cryptographic signing and encrypting. Each of the secrets in the Keystore is associated with a string which is a handle needed when using that secret for some cryptographic operation.  Our cryptographic implementation is based on libsodium, and the seeds use their notions of context and index for key derivation paths.  This implementation allows DNA developers to securely call cryptographic functions from wasm which will be executed in the conductor's secure memory space when actually doing the cryptographic processing.</p>
<p>Here are the available functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>keystore_list()</code> -&gt; returns a list of all the secret identifiers in the keystore</li>
<li><code>keystore_new_random(dst_id)</code> -&gt; creates a new random root seed identified by <code>dst_id</code></li>
<li><code>keystore_derive_seed(src_id,dst_id,context,index)</code> -&gt; derives a higherarchical deterministic key seed to be identifided by <code>dst_id</code> from the <code>src_id</code>.  Uses <code>context</code> and <code>index</code> as part of the derivation path.</li>
<li><code>keystore_derive_key(src_id,dst_id,key_type)</code>-&gt; derives a key (signing or encrypting) to be identified by <code>dst_id</code> from a previously created seed identified by <code>src_id</code>.  This function returns the public key of the keypair.</li>
<li><code>keystore_sign(src_id,payload)</code> -&gt; returns a signature of the payload as signed by the key identified by <code>src_id</code></li>
<li><code>keystore_get_public_key(src_id)</code> -&gt; returns a the public key of a key identified by <code>src_id</code>.  Returns an error if you pass an identifier of a seed secret.</li>
<li><code>sign(payload)</code> -&gt; signs the payload using the DNA's instance agent ID public key.  This is a convenience function which is equivalent to calling <code>keystore_sign(&quot;primary_keybundle:sign_key&quot;,payload)</code></li>
<li><code>sign_one_time(payload_list)</code> -&gt; signs the payloads with a randomly generated key-pair, returning the signatures and the public key of the key-pair after shredding the private-key.</li>
<li><code>verify_signature(provenance, payload)</code> -&gt; verifies that the <code>payload</code> matches the <code>provenance</code> which is a public key/signature pair.</li>
<li><code>encrypt(payload)</code> -&gt; encrypts a message with the <code>agent</code> private key.</li>
<li><code>decrypt(payload)</code> -&gt; decrypts a message with the <code>agent</code> private key</li>
</ul>

<a class="header" href="#emitting-signals" id="emitting-signals"><h1>Emitting Signals</h1></a>
<p>Holochain provides a mechanism for clients to subscribe to various signals
that are emitted by different parts the system,
some of them low level, and other explicitly by zome developers.</p>
<p>Low level signals are used by our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/diorama">testing frame work</a>.
High level signals produced by zomes can be used by UIs to receive
&quot;Application&quot; level notifications of events.</p>
<p>A signal consists of a name and a content represented as a <code>JsonString</code>.
Best practice for creating type safe <code>JsonString</code>s is by having a struct
derive from <code>DefaultJson</code> like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, DefaultJson)]
struct SignalPayload {
    message: String
}
let message = &quot;Hello World&quot;.to_string();
hdk::emit_signal(&quot;message_received&quot;, SignalPayload{message});
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This will send a signal with the following JSON representation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  signal_type: 'User', 
  name: 'message_received', 
  arguments: '{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Hello World&quot;}',
}
</code></pre>
<p>User signals (those emitted by <code>hdk::emit_signal</code>) are sent over
all websocket interfaces that include the instance that is emitting
a signal.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/hc-web-client">hc-web-client</a> enables
UIs to easily listen for signals by registering a callback through
<code>onSignal</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const { onSignal } = await this.webClientConnect({url})

onSignal((msg) =&gt; {
  console.log(msg.signal) // -&gt; { signal_type: 'User', name: 'test-signal', arguments: '{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;test message&quot;}' }
})
</code></pre>

needed to not force UIs to poll for new data, given that the DNA uses
callbacks (mainly node-2-node messages and <code>receive</code>) to emit signals
as needed.</p>
<p>Future additions will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal signature description in the DNA
<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/blob/develop/doc/architecture/decisions/0013-signals-listeners-model-and-api.md">ADR 13</a>
describes signals as statically defined properties of a DNA which
would enable conductor level binding/connecting of signals with
slotes (i.e. zome functions) similar to bridges but with looser
coupling.</li>
<li>DHT level signals/hooks
Local changes like authoring a new entry could already emit a signal
and thus trigger a reload/re-render of the UI.
But what if a remote agent authored a chat message in a channel
I'm following?
It would be very handy to have DNA hooks (i.e. callbacks) that get
called when a DHT node has validated and starts holding a new entry
or link, such that either a node-2-node message can be sent to a set
of observers, or introduce the concept of network level signals that
do exactly that automatically.</li>

<a class="header" href="#overview-2" id="overview-2"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>A Zome API Function is any Holochain core functionality that is exposed as a
callable function within Zome code.</p>
<p>Compare this to a Zome Callback Function, which is implemented by the Zome code
and called by Holochain.</p>
<p>So, Zome functions (functions in the Zome code) are called by Holochain,
which can optionally call Zome API Functions, and then finally return a
value back to Holochain.</p>
<pre><code>Holochain &quot;blocks&quot; (meaning it pauses further execution in processor threads)
  -&gt; calls Zome function
  -&gt; executes WASM logic compiled from Zome language
  -&gt; Zome logic calls zome API function
    -&gt; Holochain natively executes Zome API function
    -&gt; Holochain returns value to Zome function
  -&gt; Zome function returns some value
  -&gt; Holochain receives final value of Zome function
</code></pre>
<p>Each Zome API Function has a canonical name used internally by Holochain.</p>
<p>Zome code can be written in any language that compiles to WASM. This means the
canonical function name and the function name in the Zome language might be
different. The Zome language will closely mirror the canonical names, but naming
conventions such as capitalisation of the zome language are also respected.</p>
<p>For example, the canonical <code>verify_signature</code> might become <code>verifySignature</code> in
AssemblyScript.</p>
<p>When a Zome API function is called from within Zome code a corresponding Rust
function is called. The Rust function is passed the current Zome runtime and the
arguments that the zome API function was called with. The Rust function connects
Zome logic to Holochain core functionality and often has side effects. The
return value of the Rust function is passed back to the Zome code as the return
of the Zome API function.</p>

<a class="header" href="#building-holochain-apps-packaging" id="building-holochain-apps-packaging"><h1>Building Holochain Apps: Packaging</h1></a>
<p>The <code>hc package</code> command will automate the process of compiling your Zome code, encoding it, and inserting into the <code>.dna.json</code> file. In order to get these benefits, you just need to make sure that you have the right compilation tools installed on the machine you are using the command line tools from, and that you have the proper configuration files in your Zome folders.</p>
<p><code>hc package</code> works with two special files called <a href="./hcignore_files.html"><code>.hcignore</code> files</a> and <a href="./build_files.html"><code>.hcbuild</code> files</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hcbuild-files" id="hcbuild-files"><h1>.hcbuild Files</h1></a>
<p>In the process of building a <code>.dna.json</code> file during packaging, here is what Holochain does:</p>
<ul>
<li>It iterates Zome by Zome adding them to the JSON</li>
<li>For each Zome, it looks for any folders containing a <code>.hcbuild</code> file</li>
<li>For any folder with a <code>.hcbuild</code> file, it <strong>executes one or more commands from the <code>.hcbuild</code> file to create a WASM file</strong></li>
<li>It takes that built WASM file and Base64 encodes it, then stores a key/value pair for the Zome with the key as the folder name and the encoded WASM as the value</li>
</ul>
<p>When using <a href="./zome/adding_a_zome.html"><code>hc generate</code> to scaffold a Zome</a>, you will have a <code>.hcbuild</code> file automatically. If you create your Zome manually however, you will need to create the file yourself. Here's the structure of a <code>.hcbuild</code> file, using a Rust Zome which builds using Cargo as an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;steps&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;cargo&quot;,
      &quot;arguments&quot;: [
        &quot;build&quot;,
        &quot;--release&quot;,
        &quot;--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown&quot;
      ]
    },
  ],
  &quot;artifact&quot;: &quot;target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/code.wasm&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The two top level properties are <code>steps</code> and <code>artifact</code>.</p>
<p><code>steps</code> is a list of commands which will be sequentially executed to build a WASM file.</p>
<p><code>artifact</code> is the expected path to the built WASM file.</p>
<p>Under <code>steps</code>, each key refers to the bin(ary) of the command that will be executed, such as <code>cargo</code>. The value of <code>cargo</code>, the command, is an array of arguments: <code>build</code>, and the two <code>--</code> flags. In order to determine what should go here, just try running the commands yourself from a terminal, while in the directory of the Zome code.</p>
<p>That would look, for example, like running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#building-in-rust-rust---wasm-compilation-tools" id="building-in-rust-rust---wasm-compilation-tools"><h2>Building in Rust: Rust -&gt; WASM compilation tools</h2></a>
<p>If we take Zome code in Rust as an example, you will need Rust and Cargo set up appropriately to build WASM from Rust code. To enable it, run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
</code></pre>
<p>This adds WASM as a compilation target for Rust, so that you can run the previously mentioned command with <code>--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#ignoring-files-using-a-hcignore-file" id="ignoring-files-using-a-hcignore-file"><h1>Ignoring Files Using A .hcignore File</h1></a>
<p>Sometimes, you'll want to exclude files and folders in your project directory to get a straight <code>.dna.json</code> file that can be understood by Holochain. In order to do that, just create a <code>.hcignore</code> file. It has a similar structure to <code>.gitignore</code> files:</p>
<pre><code>README.md
dist
.DS_Store
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>hc package</code> command includes patterns inside <code>.gitignore</code> files automatically, so you don't have to write everything twice. Also <em>hidden</em> files are ignored by default as well.</p>
<p>Because <code>hc package</code> will attempt to package everything in the directory that is not explicitly ignored, Holochain will return an error if the DNA package is malformed. It is a common mistake to forget to exclude files or folders in the .hcignore file, so that your DNA will be valid.</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-holochain-apps-testing" id="building-holochain-apps-testing"><h1>Building Holochain Apps: Testing</h1></a>
<p>In order to provide a familiar testing framework, a <a href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs</a> version of the Holochain framework has been compiled using Rust to nodejs bindings. It is called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/holochain-nodejs">&quot;holochain-nodejs&quot;</a> and is a publicly installable package on the NPM package manager for nodejs. It enables the execution of Holochain and DNA instances from nodejs.</p>
<p>At a basic level, here is how testing the Holochain DNA you are developing works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>hc test</code> command to run a series of steps optimal for testing</li>
<li>call a JS file containing tests</li>
<li>In the JS file, import the nodejs Holochain Conductor</li>
<li>load your packaged DNA into the Conductor, and otherwise configure it</li>
<li>use exposed methods on the Conductor to make function calls to the DNA</li>
<li>check that the results are what you expect them to be</li>
</ul>
<p>For checking the results, a basic JavaScript test framework called <a href="https://github.com/substack/tape">Tape</a> has received priority support thus far, but other test frameworks can be used.</p>
<p>You have the flexibility to write tests in quite a variety of ways, open to you to explore. This chapter will overview how to approach testing Holochain DNA.</p>
<a class="header" href="#running-tests" id="running-tests"><h1>Running Tests</h1></a>
<p>By default, when you use <code>hc init</code> to <a href="./new_project.html">create a new project folder</a>, it creates a sub-directory called <code>test</code>. The files in that folder are equipped for testing your project. The contents of the folder represent a simple nodejs package (in that they have a <code>index.js</code> file and a <code>package.json</code> file).</p>
<p>Tools to help with testing are also built right into the <a href="./intro_to_command_line_tools.html">development command line tools</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hc-test" id="hc-test"><h2>hc test</h2></a>
<p>Once you have a project folder initiated, you can run <code>hc test</code> to execute your tests. This combines the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Packaging your files into a DNA file, located at <code>dist/your.dna.json</code>. This step will fail if your packaging step fails.</li>
<li>Installing build and testing dependencies, if they're not installed (<code>npm install</code>)</li>
<li>Executing the test file found at <code>test/index.js</code> (<code>node test/index.js</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The tests can of course be called manually using nodejs, but you will find that using the convenience of the <code>hc test</code> command makes the process much smoother, since it includes the packaging step for when you change the DNA source files.</p>
<p><code>hc test</code> also has some configurable options.</p>
<p>If you want to run it without repackaging the DNA, run it with</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc test --skip-package
</code></pre>
<p>If your tests are in a different folder than <code>test</code>, run it with</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc test --dir tests
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>tests</code> is the name of the folder.</p>
<p>If the file you wish to actually execute is somewhere besides <code>test/index.js</code> then run it with</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc test --testfile test/test.js
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>test/test.js</code> is the path of the file.</p>
<a class="header" href="#intro-to-holochain-nodejs" id="intro-to-holochain-nodejs"><h1>Intro to holochain-nodejs</h1></a>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/holochain-nodejs">holochain-nodejs</a> module is to make integration tests and scenario tests able to be written simply and with as little boilerplate as possible. However, the module also provides even more basic functionality, making it possible to build tests with whatever tradeoff between convenience and customization is right for your project.</p>
<p>There are two primary capabilities of the module, which are introduced below.</p>
<a class="header" href="#simple-single-node-integration-tests" id="simple-single-node-integration-tests"><h2>Simple, Single Node Integration Tests</h2></a>
<p>The point of this mode of testing is simply to call Zome functions, and ensure that they produce the result you expect. It is discussed further in <a href="./nodejs_calling_zome_functions.html">calling zome functions</a> and <a href="./testing_checking_results.html">checking results</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#scenario-tests" id="scenario-tests"><h2>Scenario Tests</h2></a>
<p>The point of this mode of testing is to launch multiple instances, call functions in one, then another, and to ensure that processes involving multiple agents play out as intended. The module conveniently provides a way to sandbox the execution of these scenarios as well, so that you can test multiple without worrying about side effects. This is discussed further in <a href="./scenario_testing.html">scenario testing</a>.</p>

This returns immediately with a value, even though the test network created by the conductor is still running, sending messages back and forth between agents for purposes of validation and replication, etc. In many test cases, you will want to wait until all of this network activity has died down to advance to the next step.</p>
<p>For instance, take the very common scenario as an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice runs a zome function which commits an entry, then adds a link to that entry</li>
<li>Bob runs a zome function which attempt to get links, which should include the link added by alice</li>
</ol>
<p>If the test just uses <code>call()</code> to call that zome function, there is no guarantee that the entries committed by <code>alice.call</code> will be available on the DHT by the time <code>bob.call</code> is started. Therefore, two other functions are available.</p>
<p><strong><code>alice.callSync</code></strong> returns a Promise instead of a simple value. The promise does not resolve until network activity has completed.
<strong><code>alice.callWithPromise</code></strong> is a slightly lower-level version of the same thing. It splits the value apart from the promise into a tuple  <code>[value, promise]</code>, so that the value can be acted on immediately and the promise waited upon separately.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// If we make the closure `async`, we can use `await` syntax to keep things cleaner
scenario.run(async (stop, {alice, bob}) =&gt; {
    tape(&quot;test something&quot;, t =&gt; {
        // we can await on `callSync` immediately, causing it
        // to block until network activity has died down
        const result1 = await alice.callSync('zome', 'do_something_that_adds_links', {})
        // now bob can be sure he has access to the latest data
        const result2 = bob.call('zome', 'get_those_links', {})
        t.equal(result, 'expected value')
        // the following two steps were not necessary when using runTape:
        t.end() // end the test
        stop() // use this injected function to stop the conductor
    })
})
</code></pre>
<p>Even though we can't solve the eventual consistency problem in real life networks, we can solve them in tests when we have total knowledge about what each agent is doing.</p>

<a class="header" href="#running-holochain-apps-conductors" id="running-holochain-apps-conductors"><h1>Running Holochain Apps: Conductors</h1></a>
<p>To introduce Conductors, it is useful to zoom out for a moment to the level of how Holochain runs on devices.</p>
<p>Holochain was designed to be highly platform and system compatible.  The core logic that runs a DNA instance was written in such a way that it could be included into many different codebases as a library, thus making it easier to build different implementations on the same platform as well as across platforms (MacOSX, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, and more). Architecturally, Holochain DNAs are intended to be small composable units that provide bits of distributed data integrity functionality.  Thus most Holochain based applications will actually be assemblages of many &quot;bridged&quot; DNA instances.  For this to work we needed a distinct layer that orchestrates the data flow (i.e. zome function call requests and responses), between the transport layer (i.e. HTTP, Websockets, Unix domain sockets, etc) and the DNA instances.  We call the layer that performs these two crucial functions, the <em>Conductor</em>, and we have written a <code>conductor_api</code> library to make it easy to build actual Conductor implementations.</p>
<p>Conductors play quite a number of important roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>installing, uninstalling, configuring, starting and stopping instances of DNA</li>
<li>exposing APIs to securely make function calls into the Zome functions of DNA instances</li>
<li>accepting information concerning the cryptographic keys and agent info to be used for identity and signing, and passing it into Holochain</li>
<li>establishing &quot;bridging&quot; between DNA instances</li>
<li>serving files for web based user interfaces that connect to these DNA instances over the interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the basic functions of a Conductor, but in addition to that, a Conductor also allows for the configuration of the networking module for Holochain, enables logging, and if you choose to, exposes APIs at a special 'admin' level that allows for the dynamic configuration of the Conductor while it runs. By default, configuration of the Conductor is done via a static configuration file, written in <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>.</p>
<p>In regards to the Zome functions APIs, Conductors can implement a diversity of interfaces to perform these function calls, creating an abundance of opportunity. Another way to build Holochain into an application is to use language bindings from the Rust built version of the Conductor, to another language, that then allows for the direct use of Holochain in that language.</p>
<p>There are currently three Conductor implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./intro_to_holochain_nodejs.html">Nodejs</a>
<ul>
<li>this is built using the language bindings approach, using <a href="https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon">neon</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="./development_conductor.html">hc run</a>
<ul>
<li>this is a zero config quick Conductor for development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="./production_conductor.html"><code>holochain</code> executable</a>
<ul>
<li>this is a highly configurable sophisticated Conductor for running DNA instances long term</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The articles that follow discuss these different Conductors in greater detail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is now known as a &quot;Conductor&quot; used to be called a &quot;Container&quot;, so if you see the language of Container from other versions know that these refer to the same thing. Fun fact: because this component has such a variety of functions, there was some difficulty in naming it. The word &quot;Conductor&quot; was finally chosen because it actually implies multiple metaphors, each of which resonates with an aspect of what the Conductor does. Like an orchestra conductor, it helps several parts work together as a whole. Like a train conductor, it oversees and instructs how the engine runs. Like an electricity conductor, it allows information to pass through it.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#development-conductor" id="development-conductor"><h1>Development Conductor</h1></a>
<p>The easiest Conductor to run is built right into the <a href="./intro_to_command_line_tools.html">development command line tools</a>. It has no required configuration and is launched via the <code>hc run</code> command. Meant primarily for accelerating the development process it is useful for testing APIs or prototyping user interfaces.  The <code>hc run</code> command expects to be executed from inside a directory with valid DNA source files: The command is simply:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc run
</code></pre>
<p>This will start the DNA instance in a Conductor and open, by default, a WebSocket JSON-RPC server on port <code>8888</code>. You can find more details on how to use the API in your UI in the <a href="./json_rpc_interfaces.html">JSON-RPC interfaces article</a>.</p>
<p>The following are the options for configuring <code>hc run</code>, should you need something besides the defaults.</p>
<a class="header" href="#packaging" id="packaging"><h3>Packaging</h3></a>
<p><code>-b</code>/<code>--package</code></p>
<p>Package your DNA before running it. Recall that to <a href="">package</a> is to build the <code>yourapp.dna.json</code> file from the source files. <code>hc run</code> always looks for a DNA package file in the root of your DNA folder that should have the same name as the directory itself with suffix:  <code>.dna.json</code>, so make sure that one exists there when trying to use it. <code>hc run --package</code> will do this, or run <code>hc package</code> beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>example</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc run --package
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#storage" id="storage"><h3>Storage</h3></a>
<p><code>--persist</code></p>
<p>Persist source chain and DHT data onto the file system. By default, none of the data being written to the source chain gets persisted beyond the running of the server. This will store data in the same directory as your DNA source code, in a hidden folder called <code>.hc</code>.</p>
<p><strong>example</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc run --persist
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#interfaces" id="interfaces"><h3>Interfaces</h3></a>
<p><code>--interface</code></p>
<p>Select a particular JSON-RPC interface to serve your DNA instance over.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC interface will expose, via a port on your device, a WebSocket or an HTTP server. It can be used to make function calls to the Zomes of a DNA instance. These are covered in depth in the <a href="./json_rpc_interfaces.html">JSON-RPC interfaces article</a>.</p>
<p>The default interface is <code>websocket</code>.</p>
<p><strong>examples</strong>
To run it as HTTP, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc run --interface http
</code></pre>
<p>To explicitly run it as WebSockets, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc run --interface websocket
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#port" id="port"><h3>Port</h3></a>
<p><code>-p</code>/<code>--port</code></p>
<p>Customize the port number that the server runs on.</p>
<p><strong>example</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc run --port 3400
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#networking" id="networking"><h3>Networking</h3></a>
<p><code>--networked</code></p>
<p>Select whether the Conductor should network with other nodes that are running instances of the same DNA. By default this does not occur, instead the instance runs in isolation from the network, allowing only the developer to locally access it.</p>
<p>This option requires more configuration, which can be read about in the
<a href="./hc_configuring_networking.html">configuring networking article</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stopping-the-server" id="stopping-the-server"><h3>Stopping the Server</h3></a>
<p>Once you are done with the server, to quit type <code>exit</code> then press <code>Enter</code>, or press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#configuring-networking-for-hc-run" id="configuring-networking-for-hc-run"><h1>Configuring Networking for <code>hc run</code></h1></a>
<p><code>hc run</code> uses mock networking by default and therefore doesn't talk to any other nodes.</p>
<p>In order to have <code>hc run</code> spawn a real network instance, start it with the <code>--networked</code> option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">hc run --networked
</code></pre>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">Network spawned with bindings:
     - ipc: wss://127.0.0.1:64518/
     - p2p: [&quot;wss://192.168.0.11:64519/?a=hkYW7TrZUS1hy-i374iRu5VbZP1sSw2mLxP4TSe_YI1H2BJM3v_LgAQnpmWA_iR1W5k-8_UoA1BNjzBSUTVNDSIcz9UG0uaM&quot;]
...
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#starting-a-second-node" id="starting-a-second-node"><h3>Starting A Second Node</h3></a>
<p>Starting up a second node is a little bit more work:</p>
<a class="header" href="#step-1" id="step-1"><h4>Step 1</h4></a>
<p>Set the <code>HC_N3H_BOOTSTRAP_NODE</code> environment variable to the external p2p bound address listed by the first node. Copy-paste it from the string from the terminal log of the first node, the one that starts with &quot;/ip4/192.168&quot;.</p>
<a class="header" href="#step-2" id="step-2"><h4>Step 2</h4></a>
<p>Specify a different agent id than the first node, by setting the <code>HC_AGENT</code> environment variable. Since the first agent by default will be <code>testAgent</code>, <code>testAgent2</code> is suitable.</p>
<a class="header" href="#step-3" id="step-3"><h4>Step 3</h4></a>
<p>Specify a different port than the first node to run on. Since the port for the first node by default will be <code>8888</code>, <code>8889</code> is suitable.</p>
<p>Running the command could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">HC_AGENT=testAgent2 HC_N3H_BOOTSTRAP_NODE=wss://192.168.0.11:64519/?a=hkYW7TrZUS1hy-i374iRu5VbZP1sSw2mLxP4TSe_YI1H2BJM3v_LgAQnpmWA_iR1W5k-8_UoA1BNjzBSUTVNDSIcz9UG0uaM hc run --port 8889
</code></pre>
<p>In the terminal logs that follow, you should see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">(libp2p) [i] QmUmUF..V71C new peer QmeDpQLchA9xeLDJ2jyXBwpe1JaQhFRrnWC2JfyyET2AAM
(libp2p) [i] QmUmUF..V71C found QmeDpQLchA9xeLDJ2jyXBwpe1JaQhFRrnWC2JfyyET2AAM in 14 ms
(libp2p) [i] QmUmUF..V71C ping round trip 37 ms
(libp2p) [i] QmUmUF..V71C got ping, sending pong
</code></pre>
<p>This means that the nodes are able to communicate! Watch the logs for gossip, as you take actions (that alter the source chain) in either node.</p>
<a class="header" href="#production-conductor" id="production-conductor"><h1>Production Conductor</h1></a>
<p>In addition to the zero config development Conductor using <code>hc run</code>, there is a highly configurable sophisticated Conductor for running DNA instances long term.</p>
<p>This Conductor will play an important role in making the use of Holochain truly easy for end users, because it supports all the functionality that those users are likely to want, in terms of managing their Holochain apps, or hApps, just on a low level. On that note, a graphical user interface that exposes all the functionality of this Conductor to users is under development.</p>
<p>For now, use of this Conductor must happen mostly manually, and by tech-savvy users or developers.</p>
<p>This Conductor is simply a command line tool called <code>holochain</code>. Its only function is to boot a Conductor based on a configuration file, and optionally, the ability to write changes back to that file. Within that Conductor many DNA instances can be run for one or more agents, multiple types of interfaces to the APIs can be exposed, UI file bundles can be served, and logs from all of that can be accessed.</p>
<p>The first step to using <code>holochain</code> is of course installing it. Instructions for installation can be found in its <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/tree/develop/conductor#install">README</a>. If you wish to attempt any of the things you read in this chapter while going through it, you will need to have installed the executable.</p>
<p>Like Holochain core, this particular Conductor is written in Rust. View it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/tree/develop/conductor">here</a>.</p>
<p>To understand how to configure the <code>holochain</code> Conductor, check out the <a href="./intro_to_toml_config.html">next article</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#intro-to-toml-config-files" id="intro-to-toml-config-files"><h1>Intro to TOML Config Files</h1></a>
<p>To configure the <code>holochain</code> Conductor, a configuration file format called TOML is used. It stands for &quot;Tom's Obvious Minimal Language&quot; and was created by Tom Preston-Werner, one of the original founders of GitHub. The <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">documentation on GitHub</a> for it is very good.</p>
<p><code>holochain</code> configuration files make heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#table">tables</a> and <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#array-of-tables">arrays of tables</a>.</p>
<p>A table is actually a collection of key/value pairs, and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[table-1]
key1 = &quot;some string&quot;
key2 = 123
</code></pre>
<p>An array of tables looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[products]]
name = &quot;Hammer&quot;
sku = 738594937

[[products]]
name = &quot;Nail&quot;
sku = 284758393
color = &quot;gray&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This represents two &quot;product&quot; items in an array.</p>
<p>In the following articles, how to configure the various properties of the <code>holochain</code> Conductor using these will be expanded on. First, knowing how to reference the configuration file for use by <code>holochain</code> will be covered below.</p>
<a class="header" href="#holochain-config-files" id="holochain-config-files"><h2><code>holochain</code> Config Files</h2></a>
<p><code>holochain</code> requires a configuration file to run, which must exist in the default location, or be provided as an explicit argument. <code>holochain</code> will return an error if neither is given. The default location for the configuration file is in a subdirectory of the HOME directory on a device, at the path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># Unix (Mac &amp; Linux)
$HOME/.holochain/conductor/conductor-config.toml

# Windows
%HOME%\.holochain\conductor\conductor-config.toml
</code></pre>
<p>When executing <code>holochain</code> in a terminal, a path to a configuration file can be given. This can be done with the following option:</p>
<pre><code>--config
</code></pre>
<p>or for short</p>
<pre><code>-c
</code></pre>
<p>This could look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">holochain -c ./conductor-config.toml

<p>This is a simple key/value pair specifying a directory on the device to persist the config file, DNAs, and UI bundles, if changes are made dynamically over the JSON-RPC admin API. This is only relevant if you are running one of the <a href="./conductor_interfaces.html">interfaces</a> with <code>admin = true</code>.

<p><strong>Optional</strong></p>
<p>If you start a Conductor that has this value set, but then make no changes via the JSON-RPC admin interface, the persistence directory will not be utilized and the Conductor config file you started with will not be moved into that directory. On the other hand, if you do make any changes to the configuration by calling one of the <a href="./conductor_admin.html">dynamic admin functions</a> then whatever the value of the <code>persistence_dir</code> is for that Conductor config, it will create that directory, and then persist the modified Conductor configuration file there. It would then be wise to utilize <strong>that</strong> Conductor config in the future, instead of the original.</p>
<p>Within this <code>persistence_dir</code> that is now on the device, there are a number of possible files and folders.</p>
<p><code>conductor-config.toml</code> is the new configuration file, which will be repeatedly written to with any further dynamic updates. This is useful so that when the Conductor is stopped, or if it dies for some reason, when you restart it will behave the same as before.</p>

<a class="header" href="#json-rpc" id="json-rpc"><h2>JSON-RPC</h2></a>
<p>JSON-RPC is a specification for using the JSON data format in a particular way, that follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">&quot;Remote Procedure Call&quot;</a> pattern. Holochain uses the <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification">Version 2 specification</a> of JSON-RPC. You can see general examples of JSON-RPC <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#examples">here</a>.</p>
<p>The format for the JSON-RPC request/response pattern is really simple. A request is a JSON object  with just a few mandatory values which must be passed.</p>
<p><code>jsonrpc</code>: specifies the JSON-RPC spec this request follows. The JSON-RPC spec used by Holochain Conductors is <code>2.0</code>.</p>
<p><code>id</code>: specifies the ID for this particular request. This is so that the request and response can be matched, even if they get transmitted out of order.</p>
<p><code>method</code>: specifies the method on the &quot;remote&quot; (Holochain) to call.</p>
<p><code>params</code>: (optional) contains a JSON object which holds the data to be given as arguments to the method being called, if the method expects them.</p>

<a class="header" href="#querying-running-dna-instances" id="querying-running-dna-instances"><h2>Querying Running DNA Instances</h2></a>
<p>Holochain Conductors expose a method <code>info/instances</code>. This method returns a list of the running DNA instances in the Conductor. For each running instance, it provides the instance &quot;ID&quot;, the name of the DNA, and the agent &quot;id&quot;. The instance IDs will be particularly useful in other circumstances.</p>
<p>The method <code>info/instances</code> doesn't require any input parameters, so <code>params</code> can be left off the request.</p>

<a class="header" href="#calling-zome-functions-1" id="calling-zome-functions-1"><h2>Calling Zome Functions</h2></a>
<p>The following explains the general JSON-RPC pattern for how to call a Zome function.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>info/instances</code>, a Zome function call also expects arguments. We will need to include a JSON-RPC <code>args</code> field in our RPC call.</p>
<p>To call a Zome function, use <code>&quot;call&quot;</code> as the JSON-RPC <code>method</code>, and a <code>params</code> object with four items:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>instance_id</code>: The instance ID, corresponding to the instance IDs returned by <code>info/instances</code></li>
<li><code>zome</code>: The name of the Zome</li>
<li><code>function</code>: The name of the function</li>
<li><code>args</code>: The actual parameters of the zome function call</li>
</ol>
<p>In the last example, the instance ID &quot;test-instance&quot; was returned, which can be used here as the instance ID. Say there was a Zome in a DNA called &quot;blogs&quot;, this is the Zome name. That Zome has a function called &quot;create_blog&quot;, that is the function name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any top level keys of the <code>args</code> field should correspond <strong>exactly</strong> with the name of an argument expected by the Zome method being called.</p>

<a class="header" href="#http" id="http"><h1>HTTP</h1></a>
<p>Any coding language, or tool, which can make HTTP requests can make requests to a running DNA instance. Based on the API exposed by Holochain, these must be <code>POST</code> requests, use the &quot;application/json&quot; Content-Type, and follow the JSON-RPC standard.</p>
<p>The HTTP example below will demonstrate how easy it is to make calls to a running DNA instance, just using the cURL tool for HTTP requests from a terminal.</p>
<p>Any of these methods could be similarly called from whatever client you are using, whether that is JS in the browser, nodejs, Ruby or any other language. For maximum ease of use, we recommend searching for a JSON-RPC helper library for your language of choice, there are lots of good ones out there.</p>

<p>The following discusses how to use cURL (and thus HTTP generally) to make calls to Zome functions.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC &quot;method&quot; to use is simply &quot;call&quot;.</p>
<p>The instance ID (as seen in the <code>info/instances</code> example), the Zome name, and the function name all need to be given as values in the &quot;params&quot; value of the JSON-RPC, in addition to the arguments to pass that function. This part of the &quot;params&quot; object might look like this:
<code>{&quot;instance_id&quot;: &quot;test-instance&quot;, &quot;zome&quot;: &quot;blog&quot;, &quot;function&quot;: &quot;create_post&quot;}</code></p>
<p>Unlike <code>info/instances</code>, Zome functions usually expect arguments. To give arguments, a JSON object should be constructed, and given as <code>&quot;args&quot;</code> key of the &quot;params&quot; value. It may look like the following:
<code>&quot;args&quot;: {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;sample content&quot;}</code></p>
<p>Combining these, a request like the following could be made via cURL from a terminal:
<code>curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d '{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;instance_id&quot;: &quot;test-instance&quot;, &quot;zome&quot;: &quot;blog&quot;, &quot;function&quot;: &quot;create_post&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: { &quot;content&quot;: &quot;sample content&quot;} }}' http://127.0.0.1:8888</code></p>
<p>A response like the following might be returned:</p>

<a class="header" href="#administering-conductors" id="administering-conductors"><h1>Administering Conductors</h1></a>
<p>It is possible to dynamically configure a Conductor via a JSON-RPC interface connection. There is a powerful API that is exposed for doing so.</p>
<p>To do this, first, recall that the <code>admin = true</code> <a href="./conductor_interfaces.html#admin-bool-optional">property needs to be set</a> for the interface that should allow admin access. Second, it is helpful to review and understand the behaviours around the <a href="./conductor_persistence_dir.html"><code>persistence_dir</code> property</a> for the Conductor.</p>
<p>You can find details of the API for this functionality in the full <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/interface/struct.ConductorApiBuilder.html#method.with_admin_dna_functions">API reference material</a>. Scroll to view the <code>with_admin_dna_functions</code> comment block and the <code>with_admin_ui_functions</code> comment block. Calling these functions works exactly the same way as the other <a href="./conductor_json_rpc_api.html">JSON-RPC API calls</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="./production_conductor.html">production Conductor</a>, there is a GUI in development that will cover all this functionality, so that it does not have to be done programmatically, but can be done by any user simply point and click.</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-holochain-apps-user-interfaces" id="building-holochain-apps-user-interfaces"><h1>Building Holochain Apps: User Interfaces</h1></a>
<p>Holochain is designed to be flexible and accomodating when it comes to building user interfaces. There is not a single approach to developing user interfaces that is enforced by Holochain, though there are some approaches that have extra tooling, support and focus. First and foremost, Holochain supports APIs that make building UIs with the technologies of the web (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) easy.</p>
<p>Put simply, it is entirely possible to build a user interface for Holochain completely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-holochain-apps-bridging" id="building-holochain-apps-bridging"><h1>Building Holochain Apps: Bridging</h1></a>
<p>As you saw in <a href="./building_apps.html">Building Apps</a> each <strong>DNA</strong> has a unique hash that spawns a brand new <strong>DHT network</strong> and creates isolated <strong>source chains</strong> for each agent. Even when you change the DNA, releasing a new version of the app, it will spawn a brand new DHT network and source chains.</p>
<p>So if every app lives in an entirely separated world how can they talk to each other? This is where <strong>bridging</strong> comes into play.</p>
<p>A <strong>bridge</strong> is a connector between two apps (or two versions of the same app, for that matter) that allows a synchronous bidirectional transfer of information between them.</p>
<p>To use a bridge, right now you need to configure a <a href="./production_conductor.html">production Holochain conductor</a>, at least two instances configured, along the lines of the following example setup (in a <strong>conductor-config.toml</strong> file):</p>
<pre><code>[[instances]]
id = &quot;caller-instance&quot;
dna = &quot;caller-dna&quot;
agent = &quot;caller-agent&quot;
[instances.logger]
type = &quot;simple&quot;
[instances.storage]
type = &quot;memory&quot;

[[instances]]
id = &quot;target-instance&quot;
dna = target-dna&quot;
agent = &quot;target-agent&quot;
[instances.logger]
type = &quot;simple&quot;
[instances.storage]
type = &quot;memory&quot;

[[bridges]]
caller_id = &quot;caller-instance&quot;
callee_id = &quot;target-instance&quot;
handle = &quot;sample-bridge&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Then on the caller DNA you have to initiate the bridge call using <code>hdk::call</code> like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
    let response = match hdk::call(
        &quot;sample-bridge&quot;,
        &quot;sample_zome&quot;,
        Address::from(PUBLIC_TOKEN.to_string()), // never mind this for now
        &quot;sample_function&quot;,
        json!({
            &quot;some_param&quot;: &quot;some_val&quot;,
        }).into()
    ) {
        Ok(json) =&gt; serde_json::from_str(&amp;json.to_string()).unwrap(), // converts the return to JSON
        Err(e) =&gt; return Err(e)
    };
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>And the corresponding target / callee DNA on the other end should have a zome called &quot;sample_zome&quot;, with a function as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn handle_sample_function(some_param: String) -&gt; ZomeApiResult&lt;Address&gt; {
    // do something here
}

define_zome! {
    entries: []

    init: || { Ok(()) }

    validate_agent: |validation_data : EntryValidationData::&lt;AgentId&gt;| {
        Ok(())
    }

    functions: [
        sample_function: {
            inputs: |some_param: String|,
            outputs: |result: ZomeApiResult&lt;Address&gt;|,
            handler: handle_sample_function
        }
    ]

    traits: {
        hc_public [
            sample_function
        ]
    }
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Remember that the <strong>call</strong> will block the execution of the caller DNA until the callee (target) finishes executing the call, so it's best to mind performance issues when working with bridges. Try to make contextual or incremental calls rather than all-encompassing ones.</p>

<a class="header" href="#holochain-zomes-are-written-in-wasm" id="holochain-zomes-are-written-in-wasm"><h3>Holochain zomes are written in WASM.</h3></a>
<p>WASM only supports working directly with integers and manually allocating
memory. This means that sharing any data between holochain core and zome
functions must be serialized. There is no way that WASM functions can
understand the Rust type system natively. Serialized data can be allocated for
WASM to read out and deserialize into Rust types/structs/enums.</p>
<p>Any developers using the Rust HDK get the serialization/deserialization and
type handling <em>almost</em> &quot;for free&quot;. The macros for defining entities and zomes
automatically wrap the memory work and serialization round trips for anything
that implements <code>Into&lt;JsonString&gt;</code> and <code>TryFrom&lt;JsonString&gt;</code> (see below).</p>
<p>We use <code>serde</code> for our serialization round trips as it is by far the most
popular and mature option for Rust. Many serialization formats other than JSON
are supported by <code>serde</code> but JSON is a solid option. JSON allows us to easily
bring the Rust type system across to WASM with decent performance.</p>
<p>From the <code>serde_json</code> github repository README:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is fast. You should expect in the ballpark of 500 to 1000 megabytes per
second deserialization and 600 to 900 megabytes per second serialization,
depending on the characteristics of your data. This is competitive with the
fastest C and C++ JSON libraries or even 30% faster for many use cases.
Benchmarks live in the serde-rs/json-benchmark repo.</p>

<a class="header" href="#holochain-aims-to-support-all-wasm-languages-not-just-rustjs" id="holochain-aims-to-support-all-wasm-languages-not-just-rustjs"><h3>Holochain aims to support all WASM languages not just Rust/JS</h3></a>
<p>The official Holochain HDK is Rust. The Rust HDK will
always be the most tightly integrated HDK with core simply because Holochain
itself is Rust based.</p>
<p>Generally though, we are hoping and expecting many different WASM zome
languages build an ecosystem over time. Personally I'm hoping for a decent LISP
to appear ;)</p>
<p>To encourage as many languages as possible we want to keep the minimum
requirements for interacting with holochain core as minimal as possible.</p>
<p>Currently the two requirements for writing zomes in <code>&lt;your favourite language&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must compile to WASM</li>
<li>Must be able to serialize UTF-8 data and allocate to memory read by core</li>
</ul>
<p>We can't do much about the first requirement but here are some lists to watch:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs</li>
<li>https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm</li>
</ul>
<p>The second requirement means that we must be very mindful of choosing a
serialization format that can round trip through as many languages as possible.</p>
<p>In the end, this is the main reason we chose JSON for communication with core.</p>
<p>Note that at the time of writing, the AssemblyScript (ostentisbly JavaScript)
WASM implementation does not even provide a native <code>JSON.parse()</code> method!
To do something as apparently simple as serialize JSON in JavaScript we have
had to implement a custom JSON parser. At least JSON (naturally) maps very well
to JavaScript native data, other serialization/language combinations are even
further from maturity.</p>
<p>WASM is very promising but very immature so esoteric serialization options are
not really viable options right now, even if <code>serde</code> supports them in Rust.</p>
<a class="header" href="#json-serialization-only-pertains-to-communication-with-core" id="json-serialization-only-pertains-to-communication-with-core"><h3>JSON serialization only pertains to communication with core</h3></a>
<p>Holochain often makes a distinction between &quot;app data&quot; and &quot;core data&quot;.
Following the biomimicry theme we sometimes call this &quot;conscious&quot; vs.
&quot;subconscious&quot; when this data is used in zomes or core logic respectively.</p>
<p>The most obvious example of this is the <code>Entry</code> enum that has an <code>Entry::App</code>
variant explicitly for app data, and other variants for system logic.</p>
<p>The <code>Entry</code> enum itself is serialized via JSON so that is has maximal
compatibility across all zome languages (see above) across the core/wasm
boundary. However, the <em>contents</em> of <code>Entry::App(..)</code> are treated as an opaque
UTF-8 string by Holochain core. Naturally the HDK macros we offer provide sugar
to work with the value of app entries but this is not enforced anywhere within
core. Because the Rust serialization round tripping must work across both core
and the HDK it must work equally well while treating the app entry values as
opaque in the subconscious and meaningful structs in the conscious. This is
achieved through a healthy dose of compiler and macro magic.</p>
<p>This means that zome developers can implement their own serialization logic for
their own data if they wish. Simply by wrapping a zome-serialized app entry
value in <code>&quot;\&quot;...\&quot;&quot;</code> it becomes a string primitive from core's perspective. The
zome can do anything needed with this, including custom validation logic, etc.
The <code>RawString</code> type handles this automatically with <code>JsonString</code> (see below).</p>

<p>The <code>serde</code> crate leans heavily on the Rust compiler for serialization round
tripping.</p>
<p>Using the &quot;vanilla&quot; <code>serde_json</code> crate affords this logic on the way in:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo_json = serde_json::to_string(foo).unwrap();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an <code>unwrap</code> but this can't fail for simple structs/enums in practise
<ul>
<li>The <code>unwrap</code> can fail e.g. serializing streams but we don't do that</li>
<li>The compiler enforces that everything we pass to <code>serde</code> can <code>Serialize</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>foo</code> can be anything that implements <code>Serialize</code></li>
<li>we have no direct control over the structure of the JSON output
<ul>
<li>the <code>Serialize</code> implementation of <code>foo</code> decides this for us</li>
<li>in the case of nested data e.g. hash maps, <code>Serialize</code> works recursively</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OR using the manual <code>json!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo_json = json!({&quot;foo&quot;: foo.inner()});
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We no longer have an <code>unwrap</code> so there is slightly less boilerplate to type</li>
<li>We have a lot of direct control over the structure of our output JSON</li>
<li>For better or worse we avoid what the compiler says about <code>Serialize</code> on <code>Foo</code></li>
<li>We must now manually ensure that <code>&quot;{\&quot;foo\&quot;:...}&quot;</code> is handled <em>everywhere</em>
<ul>
<li>Including in crates we don't control</li>
<li>Including when we change our JSON structure across future releases</li>
<li>Including across WASM boundaries in HDK consumers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AND on the way out:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo: Foo = Foo::try_from(&amp;hopefully_foo_json)?;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serde relies on compiler info, the type <code>Foo</code> on the left, to deserialize</li>
<li>Serde requires that <code>hopefully_foo_json</code> makes sense as <code>Foo</code>
<ul>
<li>This <em>definitely can</em> fail as the json is just a <code>String</code> to the compiler</li>
<li>In real code do not <code>unwrap</code> this, handle the <code>Err</code> carefully!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#json-structure-the-rust-compiler-and-you" id="json-structure-the-rust-compiler-and-you"><h3>JSON structure, the Rust compiler and you</h3></a>
<p>All this means that our JSON data MUST closely align with the types we define
for the compiler. There is a lot of flexibility offered by <code>serde</code> for tweaking
the output (e.g. lowercasing names of things, modifying strings, etc.) but the
tweaks involve a lot of boilerplate and have limits.</p>
<p>For example this can be awkard when handling <code>Result</code> values. The <code>Result</code> enum
has two variants in Rust, <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. Both of these, like all enum variants
in Rust, follow the title case convention.</p>
<p>This means that in a JS conductor/HDK consuming JSON values returned from zome
functions that return a <code>Result</code> (a good idea!) we see this JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const result = app.call(...)
const myVar = result.Ok...
</code></pre>
<p>We get a <code>result.Ok</code> rather than the <code>result.ok</code> that we'd expect from
idiomatic JavaScript.</p>
<p>As the JSON structure comes from the Rust compiler, we have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force serde to output JSON that follows the conventions of another language</li>
<li>Force conductors/HDKs to provide sugar to map between Rust/XXX idioms</li>
<li>Force developers to work with a very leaky abstraction over the Rust compiler</li>
</ul>
<p>As the first option requires a lot of boilerplate and isn't interoperable
across all languages anyway (e.g. kebab case, snake case, etc.) we currently
are pushing this sugar down to conductor/HDK implementations. Additionally, the
serialized form of entries is used to calculate <code>Address</code> values for storage
and retrieval from the local chain and DHT so we need to be very careful here
as it will be hard to change in the future.</p>
<p>That said, we are open to constructive feedback on what this sugar looks like
and how it works! Ideally zome development is as idiomatic as possible across
as many languages as possible 🕶</p>
<a class="header" href="#binary-data-as-base64" id="binary-data-as-base64"><h3>Binary data as base64</h3></a>
<p>We recommend base64 encoding binary data straight into an app entry string that
you can use in your zome logic directly (see above).</p>
<p>Yes this uses more space than binary data, 33% more to be specific :(</p>
<p>But there are benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is UTF-8 and web (e.g. data URI) friendly</li>
<li>Simply wrapped in <code>&quot;\&quot;..\&quot;&quot;</code> it becomes valid JSON (see <code>RawString</code> below)</li>
<li>It has wide language support (see above for why this is important)</li>
<li>It will be supported by all persistence backends for the forseeable future
<ul>
<li>At least these storage systems require base64 encoded data at some point:
<ul>
<li>Browser based localStorage</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Amazon SimpleDB</li>
<li>Amazon DynamoDB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a class="header" href="#json-is-lame-can-holochain-support-my-favourite-serialization-format" id="json-is-lame-can-holochain-support-my-favourite-serialization-format"><h3>JSON is lame! Can Holochain support <code>&lt;my favourite serialization format&gt;</code>?</h3></a>
<p>Yes... and no...</p>
<p>It depends what you mean by &quot;support&quot;.</p>
<p>Right now, most serialization formats are supported in app/zome data simply by
wrapping the output in double quotes so core sees it as a JSON string literal.
Holochain core won't try to interpret/mangle any of that data so the zome can
theoretically do whatever it wants at that point without a performance hit.</p>
<p>In practise, there are some limitations as mentioned in this doc:</p>
<ul>
<li>WASM languages tend to have no or limited serialization options
<ul>
<li>you may need to roll your own parse/stringify logic</li>
<li>seriously... e.g. we pushed our own <code>JSON.parse</code> implementation upstream
for the AssemblyScript team, that's <em>JSON parsing in JavaScript</em>!</li>
<li>don't underestimate how bleeding edge and limited the WASM tooling still is
<ul>
<li>to work directly with WASM you must be prepared to bleed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you don't use JSON you can't use <code>hdk</code> macros for that part of your zome</li>
<li>Only valid UTF-8 strings are supported (may change in the future)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're looking for a way to provide core data in non-JSON format then NO
that is not supported and won't be in the short-mid term future.</p>
<p>Yes, <code>serde</code> supports many serialization options but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all data in core uses default <code>serde</code> serialization logic
<ul>
<li>e.g. this document explaining non-default serde serialization logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swapping to a different serializer in serde is not just a matter of passing
config to serde
<ul>
<li>we'd have to centralise/<code>match</code> everywhere and swap out <code>serde_json</code> for
analogous crates in each other format we'd want to use</li>
<li>even using a <code>SerialString</code> instead of <code>JsonString</code> (see below) would not
clear out every implementation without a lot of work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Serde is already quite heavy in compilation/WASM files so we don't want to
bloat that more with edge-case serialization needs
<ul>
<li>every new format is a new crate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We don't (yet) have any use-cases showing that JSON is a problem/bottleneck</li>
<li>Adding more serialization options would exacerbate non-idiomatic conductor
and HDK data structure mapping issues (see above)</li>
</ul>

<a class="header" href="#the-problem-and-our-solution" id="the-problem-and-our-solution"><h3>The problem and our solution</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes we want to <em>nest</em> serialization (e.g. <code>hdk::call</code>) and sometimes we
want to <em>wrap</em> serialization (e.g. <code>Entry::App</code>), sometimes converting to a
string uses entirely different logic (e.g. error values). Ideally we want the
compiler to guide us through this process as mistakes are common and difficult
to debug. We also want serialization logic to be as invisible as possible to
zome developers using our HDKs.</p>
<p>Serde will serialize anything that implements <code>Serialize</code>, including <code>String</code>
so we added a type <code>JsonString</code> that does not <em>automatically</em> round trip to act
as a logical &quot;checkpoint&quot; in our code.</p>
<p><code>JsonString</code> doesn't &quot;do&quot; anything beyond giving ourselves and the compiler a
shared target while stepping through the serialization round trip.</p>
<p>Essentially we trade this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// foo_a is a Foo
// foo_json is a String
// Foo implements Serialize and Deserialize
let foo_json = serde_json::to_string(&amp;foo_a)?;
let foo_b: Foo = serde_json::from_str(&amp;foo_json)?;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>for this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// foo_a is a Foo
// JsonString implements From&lt;Foo&gt;
// Foo implements TryFrom&lt;JsonString&gt;
let foo_json = JsonString::from(foo_a);
let foo_b = Foo::try_from(hopefully_foo_json)?;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Which looks very similar but protects us from this bug:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo_json = serde_json::to_string(&amp;foo_a)?;
let foo_json = serde_json::to_string(&amp;foo_json)?; // &lt;-- double serialized :/
let foo_b: Foo = serde_json::from_str(&amp;foo_json)?; // &lt;-- will fail :(
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Because nesting <code>JsonString::from()</code> calls is a compiler error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo_json = JsonString::from(JsonString::from(foo_a)); // &lt;-- compiler saves us :)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>and this bug:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo_a: Foo = serde_json::from_str(&amp;string_but_not_json)?; // &lt;-- runtime error :(
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Because calling <code>Foo::try_from(String)</code> is (probably) a compiler error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo_a = Foo::try_from(string_but_not_json)?; // &lt;-- compiler saves us again :)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>and this bug:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
type Foo = Result&lt;String, String&gt;;
let foo_json_a = json!({&quot;Err&quot;: some_error.to_string()}); // &lt;-- good key `Err`
// somewhere else... maybe a different crate or old crate version...
let foo_json_b = json!({&quot;error&quot;: some_error.to_string()}); // &lt;-- bad key `error` :/

let foo: Foo = serde_json::from(&amp;foo_json_a)?; // &lt;-- works, key matches variant name
let foo: Foo = serde_json::from(&amp;foo_json_b)?; // &lt;-- runtime error! :(
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Because the structure of the JSON data is defined centrally at compile time:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// Result&lt;Into&lt;JsonString&gt;, Into&lt;JsonString&gt;&gt; is implemented for you by HC core
let foo_json_a = JsonString::from(Err(some_error.to_string()));
// only one way to do things, automatically consistent across all crates
// doing anything different is a compiler issue
let foo_json_b = JsonString::from(Err(some_error.to_string()));
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Which is great for the majority of data that needs serializing. There are some
important edge cases that we need to cover with additional techniques/tooling.</p>
<a class="header" href="#string-handling" id="string-handling"><h4>String handling</h4></a>
<p><code>JsonString::from_json(&amp;str)</code> requires the <code>&amp;str</code> passed to it is already a
serialized JSON value. We may add the option to validate this for debug builds at runtime in the future.</p>
<p>Previously <code>JsonString</code> implemented the <code>From&lt;String&gt;</code> trait but this was removed. Strings are a special case as they may either contain serialized json or be used as a JSON string primitive. <code>JsonString::from_json</code> makes it explicit that you mean the former.</p>
<p>We can use <code>serde_json::to_string</code> and <code>json!</code> to create JSON data that we can
then wrap in <code>JsonString</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// same end result for both of these...
let foo_json = JsonString::from_json(&amp;serde_json::to_string(&amp;foo));
let foo_json = JsonString::from(foo);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>More commonly useful, we can move back and forward between <code>String</code> and
<code>JsonString</code> without incurring serialization overhead or human error:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// this does a round trip through types without triggering any serde
JsonString::from_json(&amp;String::from(JsonString::from(foo)));
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is helpful when a function signature requires a <code>String</code> or <code>JsonString</code>
argument and we have the inverse type. It also helps when manually building
JSON data by <em>wrapping</em> already serialized data e.g. with <code>format!</code>.</p>
<p>An example taken from core:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn result_to_json_string&lt;T: Into&lt;JsonString&gt;, E: Into&lt;JsonString&gt;&gt;(
    result: Result&lt;T, E&gt;,
) -&gt; JsonString {
    let is_ok = result.is_ok();
    let inner_json: JsonString = match result {
        Ok(inner) =&gt; inner.into(),
        Err(inner) =&gt; inner.into(),
    };
    let inner_string = String::from(inner_json);
    JsonString::from_json(&amp;format!(
        &quot;{{\&quot;{}\&quot;:{}}}&quot;,
        if is_ok { &quot;Ok&quot; } else { &quot;Err&quot; },
        inner_string
    ))
}

impl&lt;T: Into&lt;JsonString&gt;, E: Into&lt;JsonString&gt; + JsonError&gt; From&lt;Result&lt;T, E&gt;&gt; for JsonString {
    fn from(result: Result&lt;T, E&gt;) -&gt; JsonString {
        result_to_json_string(result)
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Which looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let result: Result&lt;String, HolochainError&gt; =
    Err(HolochainError::ErrorGeneric(&quot;foo&quot;.into()));

assert_eq!(
    JsonString::from(result),
    JsonString::from(&quot;{\&quot;Err\&quot;:{\&quot;ErrorGeneric\&quot;:\&quot;foo\&quot;}}&quot;),
);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When given a <code>Result</code> containing any value that can be turned into a
<code>JsonString</code> (see below), we can <em>convert</em> it first, then <em>wrap</em> it with
<code>String::from</code> + <code>format!</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#string-serialization" id="string-serialization"><h3>String serialization</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes we <em>want</em> a <code>String</code> to be serialized as a JSON string primitive
rather than simply wrapped in a <code>JsonString</code> struct. <code>JsonString::from</code> won't
do what we need because it always wraps strings, we need to <em>nest</em> the <code>String</code>
serialization.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo = String::from(JsonString::from_json(&quot;foo&quot;)); // &quot;foo&quot; = not what we want
let foo = ???; // &quot;\&quot;foo\&quot;&quot; = what we want
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To keep the type safety from <code>JsonString</code> and nest String serialization use
<code>RawString</code> wrapped in <code>JsonString</code>. <code>RawString</code> wraps <code>String</code> and serializes
it to a JSON string primitive when <code>JsonString</code>ified.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// does what we need :)
let foo = String::from(JsonString::from(RawString::from(&quot;foo&quot;))); // &quot;\&quot;foo\&quot;&quot;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>An example of this can be seen in the core version of the <code>Result</code>
serialization from above that deals with <code>String</code> error values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl&lt;T: Into&lt;JsonString&gt;&gt; From&lt;Result&lt;T, String&gt;&gt; for JsonString {
    fn from(result: Result&lt;T, String&gt;) -&gt; JsonString {
        let is_ok = result.is_ok();
        let inner_json: JsonString = match result {
            Ok(inner) =&gt; inner.into(),
            // strings need this special handling c.f. Error
            Err(inner) =&gt; RawString::from(inner).into(), // &lt;-- RawString here!
        };
        let inner_string = String::from(inner_json);
        format!(
            &quot;{{\&quot;{}\&quot;:{}}}&quot;,
            if is_ok { &quot;Ok&quot; } else { &quot;Err&quot; },
            inner_string
        )
        .into()
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Which looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let result: Result&lt;String, String&gt; = Err(String::from(&quot;foo&quot;));

assert_eq!(
    JsonString::from(result),
    JsonString::from(&quot;{\&quot;Err\&quot;:\&quot;foo\&quot;}&quot;),
)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we didn't do this then the <code>format!</code> would return invalid JSON data with the
String error value missing the wrapping double quotes.</p>
<p><code>RawString</code> is useful when working with types that have a <code>.to_string()</code> method
or similar where the returned string is <em>not</em> valid JSON.</p>
<p>Examples of when <code>RawString</code> could be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error descriptions that return plain text in a string</li>
<li>Base64 encoded binary data</li>
<li>Enum variants with custom string representations</li>
<li>&quot;Black boxing&quot; JSON data that Rust should not attempt to parse</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#implementing-jsonstring-for-custom-types" id="implementing-jsonstring-for-custom-types"><h3>Implementing <code>JsonString</code> for custom types</h3></a>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two trait implementations that every struct or
enum should implement to be compatible with core serialization logic:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>impl From&lt;MyType&gt; for JsonString</code> to serialize <code>MyType</code></li>
<li><code>impl TryFrom&lt;JsonString&gt; for MyType</code> to attempt to deserialize into <code>MyType</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>TryFrom</code> is currently an unstable Rust feature. To enable it add
<code>!#[feature(try_from)]</code> to your crate/zome.</p>
<p>Based on discussions in the Rust community issue queues/forums, we expect this
feature to eventually stabilise and no longer require feature flags to use.</p>
<p>The <code>TryFrom</code> trait will need to be added as <code>use std::convert::TryFrom</code> to
each module/zome implementing it for a struct/enum.</p>
<a class="header" href="#boilerplate" id="boilerplate"><h4>Boilerplate</h4></a>
<p>To defer all the logic to standard <code>serde</code> defaults with some sensible
debug logic in the case of an error, there are two utility functions in core,
<code>default_to_json</code> and <code>default_try_from_json</code>.</p>
<p>The standard minimal boilerplate looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct MyType {}

impl From&lt;MyType&gt; for JsonString {
  fn from(my_type: MyType) -&gt; Self {
    default_to_json(my_type)
  }
}

impl TryFrom&lt;JsonString&gt; for MyType {
  type Error = HolochainError;
  fn try_from(json_string: JsonString) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Self::Error&gt; {
    default_try_from_json(json_string)
  }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#automatic-derive" id="automatic-derive"><h4>Automatic derive</h4></a>
<p>The standard boilerplate has been implemented as a derive macro in the
<code>holochain_persistence_derive</code> crate.</p>
<p>Simply <code>#[derive(DefaultJson)]</code> to add the above boilerplate plus some extra
conveniences (e.g. for references) to your type.</p>
<p><code>DefaultJson</code> requires:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>JsonString</code> is included</li>
<li><code>HolochainError</code> is included</li>
<li><code>MyType</code> implements <code>Serialize</code>, <code>Deserialize</code> and <code>Debug</code> from serde/std</li>

<a class="header" href="#using-jsonstring-as-the-property-of-a-structenum" id="using-jsonstring-as-the-property-of-a-structenum"><h3>Using JsonString as the property of a struct/enum</h3></a>
<p>Because <code>JsonString</code> cannot <em>automatically</em> be round tripped with <code>Serialize</code>
and <code>Deserialize</code>, the following can cause difficulty:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Foo {
  bar: JsonString,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The compiler will complain about this because anything deriving <code>Serialize</code>
recursively must consist only of values that also implement <code>Serialize</code>.</p>
<p>There are a few approaches here, each with benefits and tradeoffs.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Swap out <code>JsonString</code> with <code>String</code></li>
<li>Use a serde attribute to manually serialize <code>Bar</code></li>
<li>Use a serde attribute to skip <code>Bar</code></li>
<li>Create a &quot;new type&quot; or wrapper/conversion struct</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#swap-jsonstring-with-string" id="swap-jsonstring-with-string"><h4>Swap <code>JsonString</code> with <code>String</code></h4></a>
<p>This approach is quick and dirty. Simply change the type of <code>Bar</code> to <code>String</code>.
When prototyping or on deadline, this might be the most attractive option ;)</p>
<p>This will likely cause problems upstream and downstream of what you are doing,
or may be symptomatic of poorly handled JSON somewhere. This is <em>roughly</em> how
<code>Entry</code> used to work, with a <code>String</code> valued <code>SerializedEntry</code>and <code>JsonString</code>
valued <code>Entry</code> that could be swapped between using a <code>From</code> implementation.</p>
<p>Done correctly we can &quot;onboard&quot; values to <code>Foo</code> by simply carefully wrapping
and unwrapping the <code>String</code>. Done badly, we reintroduce the possibility for
invalid wrap/nest/etc. logic to creep in.</p>
<p>This works best when the fields on <code>Foo</code> are private and immutable, exposed
only through getter/setter/new style methods that internally convert between
<code>JsonString</code> and <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>This option is less suitable if we <em>want</em> to double serialize the nested JSON
data when serializing <code>Foo</code>. For an example of where we preserve JSON rather
than trying to automatically deserialize or wrap it with structs, see the
return values from <code>hdk::call</code> (not using structs, but similar ideas).</p>
<p>Also consider that somebody reading your code might entirely miss the fact that
<code>Foo::bar</code> is JSON data if all they read is the struct definition.</p>
<p>It may be worthwhile adding methods to <code>Foo</code> to enforce this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Foo {
  bar: String,
}

impl Foo {
  pub fn new(bar: JsonString) -&gt; Foo {
    Foo {bar: String::from(bar)}
  }

  pub fn bar(&amp;self) -&gt; JsonString {
    JsonString::from(self.bar.clone())
  }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Treat <code>bar</code> as though it was going to be stored as a <code>JsonString</code> right until
the last moment.</p>
<p>Avoid this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let bar_json = json!({&quot;bar&quot;: bar.inner()}).to_string();
// somwhere later...
let foo = Foo{bar: bar_json};
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Because then <em>everything</em> that needs to use <code>Foo</code> must consistently implement
the manual jsonification logic. This is especially important if <code>Foo</code> and/or
bar is to be used across multiple crates.</p>
<p>Instead, prefer this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, DefaultJson)]
struct Bar {
  bar: ..
}

let bar_json = JsonString::from(Bar{bar: ..});
let foo = Foo::new(bar); // assuming impl Foo::new from above
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The result is still a raw <code>String</code> in <code>Foo</code> but the validity and consistency of
the JSON data is enforced across all crates by <code>JsonString::from(bar)</code>.</p>
<p>It is even possible to internalise the <code>JsonString</code> completely within the <code>Foo</code>
methods using <code>Into&lt;JsonString&gt;</code>. This is covered in more detail below.</p>
<a class="header" href="#using-serde-attributes" id="using-serde-attributes"><h4>Using serde attributes</h4></a>
<p>Serde allows us to set serialization logic at the field level for structs.</p>
<p>The best example of this is handling of <code>AppEntryValue</code> in core.
As all zome data is treated as JSON, assumed to line up with internal structs
in the HDK but potentially opaque string primitives (see above) we simply alias
<code>AppEntryValue</code> to <code>JsonString</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Entry</code> enum needs to be serialized for many reasons in different contexts,
including for system entries that zome logic never handles directly.</p>
<p>It looks something like this (at the time of writing):</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, DefaultJson)]
pub enum Entry {
    #[serde(serialize_with = &quot;serialize_app_entry&quot;)]
    #[serde(deserialize_with = &quot;deserialize_app_entry&quot;)]
    App(AppEntryType, AppEntryValue),

    Dna(Dna),
    AgentId(AgentId),
    Delete(Delete),
    LinkAdd(LinkAdd),
    LinkRemove(LinkRemove),
    LinkList(LinkList),
    ChainHeader(ChainHeader),
    ChainMigrate(ChainMigrate),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that <code>Entry</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Derives <code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code> and even <code>DefaultJson</code>!</li>
<li>Contains <code>AppEntryValue</code> in a tuple, which is a <code>JsonString</code></li>
<li>Uses some serde serialization attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>This works because the serialization attributes tell serde how to handle the
<code>JsonString</code> <em>in this context</em>. This is a double edged sword. We have explicit
control over the serialization so we can never accidentally wrap/nest/etc. JSON
data in an invalid way. We also only define the serialization for this type in
this one place. If <code>AppEntryValue</code> was used in some other struct/enum, we would
have to manually remember to use the same or compatible serialize/deserialize
callbacks.</p>
<p>This approach also gives a lot of control over the final JSON structure. We can
avoid stutters and reams of redundant data in the final output. This can
mitigate the verbosity and awkwardness of compiler-driven JSON structures
when sending data to other languages (see above).</p>
<p>The serde documentation explains in great (technical) detail how to implement
custom serialization and deserialization logic for many different data types:</p>
<p>https://serde.rs/field-attrs.html</p>
<p>For reference, the callbacks used in <code>Entry</code> above look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub type AppEntryValue = JsonString;

fn serialize_app_entry&lt;S&gt;(
    app_entry_type: &amp;AppEntryType,
    app_entry_value: &amp;AppEntryValue,
    serializer: S,
) -&gt; Result&lt;S::Ok, S::Error&gt;
where
    S: Serializer,
{
    let mut state = serializer.serialize_tuple(2)?;
    state.serialize_element(&amp;app_entry_type.to_string())?;
    state.serialize_element(&amp;app_entry_value.to_string())?;
    state.end()
}

fn deserialize_app_entry&lt;'de, D&gt;(deserializer: D) -&gt; Result&lt;(AppEntryType, AppEntryValue), D::Error&gt;
where
    D: Deserializer&lt;'de&gt;,
{
    #[derive(Deserialize)]
    struct SerializedAppEntry(String, String);

    let serialized_app_entry = SerializedAppEntry::deserialize(deserializer)?;
    Ok((
        AppEntryType::from(serialized_app_entry.0),
        AppEntryValue::from(serialized_app_entry.1),
    ))
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Obviously this is a lot of boilerplate for one tuple, and is really only the
tip of the iceberg for how complex custom serde implementations can get. Use
this for surgical implementations along critical path type safety/ergonomics.</p>
<a class="header" href="#skip-the-attribute" id="skip-the-attribute"><h4>Skip the attribute</h4></a>
<p>Serde also allows for attributes to be completely skipped during serialization.</p>
<p>In the context of a <code>JsonString</code> this is unlikely to be the desired behaviour.
If we are serializing the outer struct we <em>probably</em> want the inner JSON data
to also be serialized, but not necessarily, or perhaps we don't <em>need</em> it and
so can live without it.</p>
<p>This option has very clear tradeoffs. We lose the JSON data when the outer
struct is serialized but also don't have to worry about how it might be
represented.</p>
<p>This option is very handy during development/prototyping/debugging when you
want to sketch out a larger idea without immediately tackling serde logic.</p>
<p>Simply add the <code>#[serde(skip)]</code> attribute to your struct.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Foo {
  #[serde(skip)]
  bar: JsonString,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>

<p>If it is possible to create a struct that better represents the data, or a new
type to hold it, then <em>that</em> struct can implement to/try_from <code>JsonString</code>.</p>
<p>This is very similar to the first option where we put a <code>String</code> into <code>Foo</code> but
it provides semantics, information for the compiler and somewhere to hook
<code>into()</code> for our code.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// Bar as a new type
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, DefaultJson)]
struct Bar(String)

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Foo {
  bar: Bar,
}

impl Foo {
  fn new(bar: Bar) -&gt; Foo {
    Foo { bar }
  }

  fn bar(&amp;self) -&gt; Bar {
    self.bar.clone()
  }
}

// somewhere else...
let json = JsonString::from(..);
let bar = Bar::from(json);
let foo = Foo::new(bar);

// or...
let json = JsonString::from(..);
let foo = Foo::new(json.into());
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The biggest drawback to this approach is the potential for stutter. With lots
of nested types we give the compiler more power but also can incidentally bloat
the JSON output a lot.</p>
<p>Many ad-hoc/once-off types can also become confusing for humans and lead to
duplicated/redundant code over time.</p>
<p>It is easy to end up with JSON like <code>{&quot;Foo&quot;:{&quot;bar&quot;:{&quot;Bar&quot;:[&quot;..&quot;]}}}</code> with a
poorly chosen combination of enum variants and tuples.</p>
<p>As per all the considerations outlined for using <code>String</code> directly on <code>Foo</code>,
avoid using <code>json!</code> or similar to build up the internal <code>String</code> of <code>Bar</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hiding-jsonstring-with-intojsonstring" id="hiding-jsonstring-with-intojsonstring"><h2>Hiding JsonString with <code>Into&lt;JsonString&gt;</code></h2></a>
<p>It is possible in function signatures to simply leave an argument open to
anything that can be converted to <code>JsonString</code>.</p>
<p>This is exactly like using <code>Into&lt;String&gt;</code> but for JSON data. An even looser
option is to only require <code>TryInto&lt;JsonString&gt;</code> but this makes little or no
difference to us in practise.</p>
<p>An example of this is the <code>store_as_json</code> used to pass native Rust typed data
across the WASM boundary. This is used internally by the <code>define_zome!</code> macro
for all zome funtions:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn store_as_json&lt;J: TryInto&lt;JsonString&gt;&gt;(
    stack: &amp;mut WasmStack,
    jsonable: J,
) -&gt; Result&lt;SinglePageAllocation, RibosomeErrorCode&gt; {
    let j: JsonString = jsonable
        .try_into()
        .map_err(|_| RibosomeErrorCode::ArgumentDeserializationFailed)?;

    let json_bytes = j.into_bytes();
    let json_bytes_len = json_bytes.len() as u32;
    if json_bytes_len &gt; U16_MAX {
        return Err(RibosomeErrorCode::OutOfMemory);
    }
    write_in_wasm_memory(stack, &amp;json_bytes, json_bytes_len as u16)
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The relevant <code>into()</code> or <code>try_into()</code> method is called <em>internally</em> by the
function accepting <code>Into&lt;JsonString&gt;</code>, meaning the caller needs to know almost
nothing about <em>how</em> the serialization is done. Additionally, the caller <em>could</em>
do its own custom serialization, passing a <code>String</code> through, which would be
wrapped as-is into a <code>JsonString</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this doesn't work as well for structs because of the way trait
bounds work (or don't work) without complex boxing etc. See above for simple
strategies to cope with nested/wrapped serialization in nested native data
structures.</p>
<p>This approach can be combined with the &quot;quick and dirty&quot; <code>Foo</code> with private
<code>String</code> internals to create a <code>Foo</code> that can store <em>anything</em> that round trips
through <code>JsonString</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct Foo {
  bar: String,
}

impl Foo {
  fn new&lt;J: Into&lt;JsonString&gt;&gt; (bar: J) -&gt; Foo {
    Foo{ bar: String::from(JsonString::from(bar)) }
  }

  fn bar&lt;T: TryFrom&lt;JsonString&gt;&gt;(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;T, HolochainError&gt; {
    Ok(JsonString::from(self.bar.clone()).try_into()?)
  }
}

// somewhere later..
// we can build MyBar ad-hoc to send to Foo as long as it implements JsonString
// we could create MyOtherBar in the same way and send to Foo in the same way
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, DefaultJson)]
struct MyBar { .. }

let my_bar = MyBar::new(..);
// auto stores as String via. JsonString internally
let foo = Foo::new(my_bar);
// note we must provide the MyBar type at restore time because we destroyed
// that type info during the serialization process
let restored_bar: MyBar = foo.bar()?;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is how the <code>ContentAddressableStorage</code> trait used to work. It would
&quot;magically&quot; restore the correct <code>Content</code> from storage based on an <code>Address</code>
and type alone, provided the compiler had the type info available at compile
time.</p>
<p>We had to sacrifice this neat trick due to incompatible constraints from the
type system elsewhereon the CAS, but it should work well in most scenarios :)</p>
<a class="header" href="#building-for-android" id="building-for-android"><h1>Building For Android</h1></a>
<p>Note: These instructions for building Holochain on Android are adapted from <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-browser-architecture/experiments/2017-09-21-rust-on-android.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In order to get to libraries that can be linked against when building <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holosqape">HoloSqape</a> for Android, you basically just need to setup up according targets for cargo.</p>
<p>Given that the Android SDK is installed, here are the steps to setting things up for building:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the Android tools:</p>
<p>a. Install <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">Android Studio</a>
b. Open Android Studio and navigate to SDK Tools:
- MacOS: <code>Android Studio &gt; Preferences &gt; Appearance &amp; Behaviour &gt; Android SDK &gt; SDK Tools</code>
- Linux: <code>Configure (gear) &gt; Appearance &amp; Behavior &gt; System Settings &gt; Android SDK</code>
c. Check the following options for installation and click OK:
* Android SDK Tools
* NDK
* CMake
* LLDB
d. Get a beverage of your choice (or a full meal for that matter) why you wait for the lengthy download</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup ANDROID_HOME env variable:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On MacOS</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk
</code></pre>
<p>Linux: (assuming you used defaults when installing Android Studio)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create standalone NDKs (the commands below put the NDK in your home dir but you can put them where you like):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk-bundle
cd ~
mkdir NDK
${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch arm64 --install-dir NDK/arm64
${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch arm --install-dir NDK/arm
${NDK_HOME}/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 26 --arch x86 --install-dir NDK/x86
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add the following lines to your <code>~/.cargo/config</code>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.aarch64-linux-android]
ar = &quot;&lt;your $HOME value here&gt;/NDK/arm64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ar&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>(this toml file needs absolute paths, so you need to prefix the path with your home dir).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now you can add those targets to your rust installation with:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android

<p>Finally, should now be able to build Holochain for Android with your chosen target, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>cd &lt;holochain repo&gt;
cargo build --target armv7-linux-androideabi --release
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  there is currently a problem in that <code>wabt</code> (which we use in testing as a dev dependency) won't compile on android, and the cargo builder compiles dev dependencies even though they aren't being used in release builds.  Thus as a work around, for the cargo build command above to work, you need to manually comment out the dev dependency section in both <code>core/Cargo.toml</code> and <code>core_api/Cargo.toml</code></p>

<p>Core API is a library for embedding a Holochain instance (an hApp) in your own code. So this is for the use case of writing your own software that runs hApps.

<a class="header" href="#context" id="context"><h2>Context</h2></a>
<p>Like most other distributed systems, Holochain fundamentally relies on public key cryptography. Among other uses, Holochain nodes are identified by their public keys, and thus provenance of messages from nodes can be checked simply by checking a message signature against the node's identifier.  This fundamental use requires nodes to keep the private key secret, lest the node's very agency be compromised.  Keeping such secrets in the digital age is a non-trivial problem.  Additionally, distributed systems imply an abundance of nodes with public keys, many of which may wish to be identified as being under the control of a single actor.  Solutions to this need create yet another layer of keys which sign other keys, and the management of all this can become quite complex.</p>
<p>Addressing these needs is the function of Public Key Infrastructure, and in our case, because we use the power of Holochain itself to do this, a Distributed Public Key Infrastructure: DPKI.</p>
<a class="header" href="#requirements-1" id="requirements-1"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>
<p>DPKI needs to fulfill at least the following design requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a way to create new keys for nodes.</li>
<li>Provide a way to revoke compromised keys and re-issue keys for a node.</li>
<li>Provide a way to verify the provenance of keys by grouping them as originating from a single actor.</li>
<li>Securely manage the private keys.</li>
<li>Reliably distribute and make available information about public keys.</li>
</ol>
<p>In designing a solution for DPKI we recognize that this is a complex and difficult enough problem that any solution will need to evolve, and in fact there will be multiple solutions necessary for different contexts.  Thus, we have built into the Holochain conductor a simple interface for the fundamental needed functions, e.g. creating new keys when installing a DNA for the first time, that can then be implemented by specialized DPKI applications.  Furthermore we've implemented a reference implementation of a Holochain based DPKI application, which we call DeepKey.</p>
<a class="header" href="#deepkey" id="deepkey"><h2>DeepKey</h2></a>
<p>To deliver on the basics of Distributed Public Key Infrastructure, we need a way to generate keys of various types (revocation, identity, encryption, signing) from seeds, and we need to be able to generate such seeds from primary seeds, so that a human agent can create related &quot;device agents&quot; provably under their control.</p>
<p>After studying a number of uses cases, including initial sign-up, key revocation, etc, the central insight we came to was the need to create a Hierarchical Deterministic Key generation system, based on a Primary Seed, from which additional seeds can be generated which then are in turn used to actually generate many key-pairs.  This allows us, by-convention, to use the first seed generated by the Primary seed as the seed for revocation keys, and subsequent seeds as seeds for keys of separate Holochain devices that can be proven to be under the control of the holder of Primary Seed.</p>
<p>DeepKey</p>

<a class="header" href="#keystore" id="keystore"><h3>Keystore</h3></a>
<p>For each Holochain DNA instance, the Conductor maintains a Keystore, which holds &quot;secrets&quot; (seeds and keys) needed for cryptographic signing and encrypting. Each of the secrets in the Keystore is associated with a string which is a handle needed when using that secret for some cryptographic operation.  Our cryptographic implementation is based on libsodium, and the seeds use their notions of context and index for key derivation paths.  This implementation allows DNA developers to securely call cryptographic functions from WASM which will be executed in the conductor's secure memory space when actually doing the cryptographic processing.</p>
<p>Decrypting a secret from the keystore invokes a passphrase manager service, which is used to collect the passphrase from some end-user.  This service is implementation specific.  Currently we have implementations for command-line passphrase collection for use in the <code>hc keygen</code> command, and also a command-line implementation within the conductor.</p>
<a class="header" href="#standalone-mode" id="standalone-mode"><h3>Standalone Mode</h3></a>
<p>If the Conductor config does not include a DPKI section, then the conductor assumes it's in standalone mode and takes responsibility for adding generating new agent secrets when it receives <code>admin/add_agent</code> requests through the admin interface.  This mode is also used by the <code>hc</code> command-line tool.</p>
<a class="header" href="#dpki-mode" id="dpki-mode"><h3>DPKI Mode</h3></a>
<p>If the Conductor config specifies a DPKI instance, then the conductor will initially bootstrap the DPKI instance, and also delegate any <code>admin/add_agent</code> requests to the DPKI app for processing.  Note that the Conductor does assume that basic agent key will be created by the DPKI app so that it can actually create the agent keystore file on behalf of the DPKI app.</p>
<p>The Holochain conductor expects the following exposed functions to exist in any DPKI application as a trait so that it can call them at various times to manage keys and identity.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>init(params)</code>:  Called during bootstrap with initialization parameters retrieved from the DPKI configuration.  This function is only called if a prior call to <code>is_initialied()</code> returned false.</li>
<li><code>is_initialized()</code> -&gt; bool : Should return a boolean value if the DPKI DNA has been initialized or not</li>
<li><code>create_agent_key(agent_name)</code> :  Called any time the conductor creates a new DNA instance. Should create a keystore record for the instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: add more functions for the trait.</p>

<a class="header" href="#writing-a-development-kit" id="writing-a-development-kit"><h1>Writing a Development Kit</h1></a>
<p>The end goal of a Development Kit is to simplify the experience of writing Zomes that compile to WASM for Holochain apps.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there is currently one active Developer Kit being written, for the Rust language. While it is possible to look at the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/hdk-rust">Rust language HDK</a> as a reference, this article is a more general guide that outlines what it takes to build a Development Kit.</p>
<p>If you are interested in supporting developers to write Zomes in an unsupported language, you will want to first of all check whether that language can be compiled to WebAssembly, as that is a requirement.</p>
<a class="header" href="#why-development-kits" id="why-development-kits"><h3>Why Development Kits</h3></a>
<p>Development Kits are important because the WASM interface between Zomes and Holochain is constrained to singular 64 bit integers.</p>
<p>The WASM spec allows for multiple function arguments and defines integers as neither signed nor unsigned, but Holochain only supports a single <code>u64</code> input and output for all zome functions.</p>
<p>WASM implements a single linear memory of bytes accessible by offset and length.</p>
<p>Holochain sends and receives allocated bytes of memory to zomes by treating the 64 bit integer as two 32 bit integers (high bits as offset and low bits as length).</p>
<p>If no bytes of memory are allocated (i.e. the 32 bit length is 0) the high bits map to an internal enum. This enum is contextual to the zome but typically represents errors:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub enum RibosomeErrorCode {
    Unspecified                     = 1 &lt;&lt; 32,
    ArgumentDeserializationFailed   = 2 &lt;&lt; 32,
    OutOfMemory                     = 3 &lt;&lt; 32,
    ReceivedWrongActionResult       = 4 &lt;&lt; 32,
    CallbackFailed                  = 5 &lt;&lt; 32,
    RecursiveCallForbidden          = 6 &lt;&lt; 32,
    ResponseSerializationFailed     = 7 &lt;&lt; 32,
    NotAnAllocation                 = 8 &lt;&lt; 32,
    ZeroSizedAllocation             = 9 &lt;&lt; 32,
    UnknownEntryType                = 10 &lt;&lt; 32,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Each development kit should abstract memory handling in some contextually idiomatic way.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-rust-development-kit-wasm-solution" id="the-rust-development-kit-wasm-solution"><h3>The Rust Development Kit WASM Solution</h3></a>
<p>The standard development kit implements a simple memory stack.</p>
<p>The <code>WasmAllocation</code> struct represents a pair of offset/length <code>u32</code> values.</p>
<p>The <code>WasmStack</code> struct is a single &quot;top&quot; <code>u32</code> value that tracks the current end of linear memory that can be written to (either allocation or deallocation).</p>
<p>Use of these structs is optional inside zome WASM, Holochain core will always write/read according to the input/output position represented by the <code>u64</code> arg/return values.</p>
<p>Reads and write methods are provided for both primitive Rust UTF-8 strings and <code>JsonString</code> structs.</p>
<p>Write new data to <code>WasmStack</code> as <code>stack.write_string(String)</code> and <code>stack.write_json(Into&lt;JsonString&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>If the allocation is successful a <code>WasmAllocation</code> will be returned else an <code>AllocationError</code> will result.</p>
<p>Allocation to the stack can be handled manually as <code>stack.allocate(allocation)</code> and the next allocation can be built with <code>stack.next_allocation(length)</code>.</p>
<p>Allocation on the stack will fail if the offset of the new allocation does not match the current stack top value.</p>
<p>To read a previous write call <code>let s = allocation.read_to_string()</code> and standard <code>let foo: Result&lt;Foo, HolochainError&gt; = JsonString::try_from(s)</code> for JSON deserialization.</p>
<p>To write a deallocation call <code>stack.deallocate(allocation)</code>.</p>
<p>Deallocation does not clear out WASM memory, it simply moves the top of the stack back to the start of the passed allocation ready to be overwritten by the next allocation.</p>
<p>Deallocation will fail if the allocation offset + length does not equal the current stack top.</p>
<p>Holochain compatible encodings of allocations for the return value of zome functions can be generated with <code>allocation.as_ribosome_encoding()</code>.</p>
<p>The development kit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implements the simple stack/allocation structs and methods</li>
<li>Manages a static stack for consistent writing</li>
<li>Exposes convenience functions for the Holochain API to handle relevant allocation/deallocations</li>
<li>Maps <code>u64</code> values to/from encoded error values and <code>u32</code> offset/length values for memory allocations</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details review the unit/integration test suites in <code>hdk-rust</code> and <code>wasm_utils</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#crafting-the-api" id="crafting-the-api"><h3>Crafting the API</h3></a>
<p>Using its WASM interpreter, Holochain exposes its callable Zome API functions by making them available as &quot;imports&quot; in Zome WASM modules. Per the memory discussion above, each of the Zome API functions have the same explicit function signature, but different implicit function signatures. The native functions have each been given a prefix so that Development Kit wrappers can expose a regular function name. Here is a complete list:</p>
<ul>
<li>hc_debug</li>
<li>hc_call</li>
<li>hc_sign</li>
<li>hc_verify_signature</li>
<li>hc_commit_entry</li>
<li>hc_update_entry</li>
<li>hc_update_agent</li>
<li>hc_remove_entry</li>
<li>hc_get_entry</li>
<li>hc_link_entries</li>
<li>hc_query</li>
<li>hc_send</li>
<li>hc_start_bundle</li>
<li>hc_close_bundle</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a special additional one called <code>hc_init_globals</code> which we will discuss further.</p>
<p>The Development Kit should implement and export one function per each native function from the list. The function should be called the same as its native form, but without the prefix. E.g. <code>hc_update_agent</code> should be called <code>update_agent</code> or <code>updateAgent</code>. That function should internally call the native function and handle the additional complexity around that.</p>
<p>In order to call these &quot;external&quot; functions, you will need to import them and provide their signature, but in a WASM import compatible way. In Rust, for example, this is simply:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
extern {
  fn hc_commit_entry(encoded_allocation_of_input: RibosomeEncodingBits) -&gt; RibosomeEncodingBits;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>TODO: define or link to meaningful function signatures</p>
<a class="header" href="#working-with-wasm-memory" id="working-with-wasm-memory"><h3>Working with WASM Memory</h3></a>
<p>The goal of the Development Kit is to expose a meaningful and easy to use version of the API functions, with meaningful arguments and return values. There is a bit of flexibility around how this is done, as coding languages differ. However, the internal process will be similar in nature. Here it is, generalized:</p>
<ol>
<li>declare, or use a passed, single page 64 KiB memory stack</li>
<li>join whatever inputs are given into a single serializable structure</li>
<li>serialize the given data structure as an array of bytes</li>
<li>determine byte array length</li>
<li>ensure it is not oversized for the stack</li>
<li>allocate the memory</li>
<li>write the byte array to memory</li>
<li>create an allocation pointer for the memory
a. use a 16 bit integer for the pointers <code>offset</code>
b. use a 16 bit integer for the pointers <code>length</code></li>
<li>join the pointers into a single 32 bit integer
a. high bits are <code>offset</code>
b. low bits are <code>length</code></li>
<li>call the native function with that 32 bit integer and assign the result to another 32 bit integer
a. e.g. <code>encoded_alloc_of_result = hc_commit_entry(encoded_alloc_of_input)</code></li>
<li>deconstruct that 32 bit integer into two variables
a. use a 16 bit integer for the pointers <code>offset</code>
b. use a 16 bit integer for the pointers <code>length</code></li>
<li>read string data from memory at the <code>offset</code> address</li>
<li>deallocate the memory</li>
<li>deserialize the string to JSON if JSON is expected</li>
</ol>
<p>That looks like a lot of steps, but most of this code can be shared for the various functions throughout the Development Kit, leaving implementations to be as little as 5 lines long. Basically, the process inverts at the point of the native function call.</p>

<p>TODO</p>
<a class="header" href="#app-globals" id="app-globals"><h3>App Globals</h3></a>
<p>When writing Zome code, it is common to need to reference aspects of the context it runs in, such as the active user/agent, or the DNA address of the app. Holochain exposes certain values through to the Zome, though it does so natively by way of the <code>hc_init_globals</code> function mentioned. Taking care to expose these values as constants will simplify the developer experience.</p>
<p>This is done by calling <code>hc_init_globals</code> with an input value of 0. The result of calling the function is a 32 bit integer which represents the memory location of a serialized JSON object containing all the app global values. Fetch the result from memory, and deserialize the result back into an object. If appropriate, set those values as exports for the Development Kit. For example, in Rust, values become accessible in Zomes using <code>hdk::DNA_NAME</code>. It's recommended to use all capital letters for the export of the constants, but as they are returned as keys on an object from <code>hc_init_globals</code> they are in lower case. The object has the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>dna_name</li>
<li>dna_address</li>
<li>agent_id_str</li>
<li>agent_address</li>
<li>agent_initial_hash</li>
<li>agent_latest_hash</li>
<li>public_token</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="/zome/api_globals.html">API global variables</a> page for details on what these are.</p>

<p>If you've made it through the process so far, good work. The community is an important part of the success of any project, and Holochain is no different. If you're really proud of your work, get in touch with the development team on the <a href="https://chat.holochain.net/appsup/channels/hc-core">chat server</a>, mention you're working on it, and request help if necessary. This book could be updated to include links to other HDKs. Whether you would like to, or you'd like the team to, the HDK could be published to the primary package manager in use for the language, to be used by developers around the world. For example, RubyGems for Ruby or npm for nodejs.</p>

<a class="header" href="#zome-api-functions-1" id="zome-api-functions-1"><h2>Zome API functions</h2></a>
<p>Each zome API function is implemented under <code>nucleus::ribosome::api</code>.</p>
<p>There is a fair bit of boilerplate at the moment, sorry!</p>
<p>To co-ordinate the execution of an API function across Rust and WASM we need to
define a few related items.</p>
<p>Within <code>nucleus::ribosome::api</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A variant in the <code>ZomeApiFunction</code> enum</li>
<li>The same canonical string in <em>both</em> <code>as_str</code> and <code>from_str</code></li>
<li>A mapping to the API function under <code>as_fn</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As a new module under <code>nucleus::ribosome::api</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ribosome module implementing the invocation logic as <code>invoke_*</code></li>
<li>A struct to hold/serialize any input args if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>::action</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An action if the zome API function has side effects</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#zome-api-function-definition" id="zome-api-function-definition"><h3>Zome API function definition</h3></a>
<p>Simply add the name of the new zome API function to the end of the enum.</p>
<p>Make sure to add the canonical names carefully. The Rust compiler will guide you
through the rest if you miss something.</p>
<p>DO add a doc comment summarising what the zome function does and sketching the
function signature.</p>
<p>DO extend the relevant unit tests.</p>
<p>Do NOT add to the start or middle of the enum as that will renumber the other
zome functions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#zome-api-function-ribosome-module" id="zome-api-function-ribosome-module"><h3>Zome API function ribosome module</h3></a>
<p>Each zome API function should have its own module under <code>nucleus::ribosome::*</code>.</p>
<p>Implement a public function as <code>invoke_&lt;canonical name&gt;</code>. The function must take
two arguments, a <code>&amp;mut nucleus::ribosome::Runtime</code> and a <code>&amp;wasmi::RuntimeArgs</code>.</p>
<p>This function will be called by the invocation dispatch (see above).</p>
<a class="header" href="#zome-api-function-arguments" id="zome-api-function-arguments"><h4>Zome API function arguments</h4></a>
<p>The <code>wasmi::RuntimeArgs</code> passed to the Zome API function contains only a single
<code>u64</code> value. This is an encoded representation of a single page of memory
supported by the memory manager. The 16 high bits are the memory offset and the
16 low bits are the memory length. See the <code>wasm_utils</code> crate for more
implementation details.</p>
<p>You don't have to work with the memory manager directly, simply pass the runtime
and runtime args to <code>nucleus::runtime_args_to_utf8</code> to get a utf-8 string from
memory.</p>
<p>You DO have to handle serialization round trips if you want to pass anything
other than a single utf-8 string to a zome API function.</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this is implement a struct that derives <code>Serialize</code> and
<code>Deserialize</code> from serde, then use serde and <code>.into_bytes()</code> co-ordinate the
round trip.</p>
<p>For an example implementation of a struct with several fields see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nucleus::ribosome::commit::CommitArgs</code> for the input args struct</li>
<li><code>nucleus::ribosome::commit::tests::test_args_bytes</code> serializing the struct as bytes</li>
<li><code>nucleus::ribosome::commit::invoke_commit</code> deserializing the struct from the runtime</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#zome-api-function-action-dispatch" id="zome-api-function-action-dispatch"><h4>Zome API function action dispatch</h4></a>
<p>If the function has a side effect it must send an action to the state reduction
layer.</p>
<p>Actions are covered in more detail in the state chapter.</p>
<p>In summary, if you want to send an action and wait for a return value:</p>
<ul>
<li>create an outer channel in the scope of your invoke function that will receive the return value</li>
<li>call <code>::instance::dispatch_action_with_observer</code> with:
<ul>
<li>the runtime's channels</li>
<li>the action the reducer will dispatch on</li>
<li>an observer sensor, which is a closure that polls for the action result and sends to your outer channel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>block the outer channel until you receive the action result</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#zome-api-function-return-values" id="zome-api-function-return-values"><h4>Zome API function return values</h4></a>
<p>The zome API function returns a value to wasm representing success or a wasm trap.</p>
<p>The success value can only be a single <code>u64</code>.</p>
<p>Traps are a low level wasm concern and are unlikely to be directly useful to a
zome API function implementation.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Semantics.md#traps</p>
<p>To get complex values out of wasm we use the memory manager, much like the input
argument serialization (see above).</p>
<p>The util function <code>nucleus::runtime_allocate_encode_str</code> takes a string,
allocates memory and returns the value that the zome API function must return.</p>
<p>To return an error relevant to holochain, return <code>Ok</code> with an <code>HcApiReturnCode</code>
error enum variant.</p>
<p>For an example implementation returning a complex struct see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>agent::state::ActionResponse::GetEntry</code> containing an <code>Entry</code> struct</li>
<li><code>nucleus::ribosome::get::invoke_get</code>
<ul>
<li>match the action result against the correct enum variant</li>
<li>serialize the entry using serde</li>
<li>return the result of <code>runtime_allocate_encode_str</code></li>
<li>if the action result variant does NOT match then return <code>HcApiReturnCode::ErrorActionResult</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#zome-api-function-agent-action" id="zome-api-function-agent-action"><h3>Zome API function agent action</h3></a>
<p>If the zome API function will cause side effects to the agent state then it must
implement and dispatch an action.</p>
<p>Actions are covered in more detail in the state chapter.</p>
<p>In summary, if a new agent action (for example) is needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>extend the <code>action::Action</code> enum
<ul>
<li>this sets the data type, the <code>ActionWrapper</code> provides a unique ID</li>
<li>use the canonical name if that makes sense</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>extend an <code>ActionResult</code> enum if the action has a return value</li>
<li>implement a reducer for the new action</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#state--actions" id="state--actions"><h1>State &amp; Actions</h1></a>
<p>Holochain uses a hybrid global/local state model.</p>
<p>In our bio mimicry terms the global state is for &quot;short term memory&quot; and local
state wraps references to &quot;long term memory&quot;.</p>
<p>The global state is implemented as Redux style reducers. Any module can dispatch
an action to the global state. The action will be &quot;reduced&quot; to a new state tree
value by the modules responsible for each branch of the state tree. The response
values from a reduction must be polled directly from the state tree in a thread
using a &quot;sensor&quot; closure in an observer.</p>
<p>Actions are stateless/immutable data structures that are dispatched by modules
to communicate a request to do something potentially state changing. Everything
in the system should be either stateless or change state only in response to an
incoming action.</p>
<p>The global state is called &quot;short term memory&quot; because it is highly dynamic,
readily inspectable, and volatile. It does not survive indefinitely and is best
thought of as a cache of recent history.</p>
<p>Local state is implemented using actors to co-ordinate memory and threads in
Rust for external, persistent state. The classic example is a database
connection to the database that stores entries and headers. The db actor
receives read/write messages, and a reference to the sender is stored in the
global state.</p>
<a class="header" href="#actions" id="actions"><h2>Actions</h2></a>
<p>The <code>action</code> module defines actions and action wrappers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ActionWrapper</code>: struct contains a unique ID for the action and the <code>Action</code></li>
<li><code>Action</code>: enum of specific data to a given action, e.g. <code>Action::Commit</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Processing an incoming action is a 3 step process:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Implement <code>reduce</code> to resolve and dispatch to a handler</li>
<li>Resolve the action to an appropriate handler</li>
<li>Implement handler logic</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#reduce" id="reduce"><h3>Reduce</h3></a>
<p>The <code>reduce</code> implementation is essentially copypasta. It handles resolving and
dispatching to a handler with a new state clone. The handler resolution and
dispatch logic should be split to facilitate clean unit testing.</p>

<p>See <code>src/agent/state.rs</code> and <code>src/nucleus/state.rs</code> and how they are put
together in <code>src/state.rs</code>.</p>

<p>Each incoming action wrapper is logged in the main state <code>history</code> to facilitate

<p>Sub-module state slices are included in <code>state::State</code> as counted references.</p>

<ul>
<li>Each Holochain agent as an actor in a networking context</li>
<li>Riker actors as an implemenation detail in the Holochain core lib</li>
</ul>
<p>This article is about the latter.</p>
<a class="header" href="#actor-model" id="actor-model"><h2>Actor model</h2></a>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a> is a relatively safe approach to co-ordinating concurrency.</p>
<p>At a high level:</p>
<ul>
<li>An actor is the &quot;primitive&quot;, like objects are the primitive of the OO paradigm</li>
<li>Actors are stateful but this state is never exposed to the rest of the system</li>
<li>Actors manage their internal state</li>
<li>Actors maintain a message queue or &quot;inbox&quot;</li>
<li>Messages can be received concurrently but must be processed sequentially in FIFO order</li>
<li>The messages have a preset format</li>
<li>Actors update their internal state in response to messages</li>
<li>Actors can send messages to each other</li>
<li>Messages are always processed at most once</li>
<li>Actors can &quot;supervise&quot; each other to create a fault tolerent system</li>
<li>A supervisor can restart or stop a failed actor, or escalate the decision to another supervisor</li>
</ul>
<p>The guarantees provided by the message queue allow actors to use stateful logic
that would not be safe otherwise in a concurrent context.</p>
<p>For example, we can implement logic that reads/writes to the file system without
locks or other co-ordination. Then put an actor in front of this logic and only
interact with the file system through the relevant actor.</p>
<a class="header" href="#riker" id="riker"><h2>Riker</h2></a>
<p><a href="http://riker.rs/">Riker</a> is an actor library for Rust.</p>
<p>The actor implementation in Riker has a few key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>protocol: a set of valid messages that can be sent (e.g. an enum)</li>
<li>actor system: manages and co-ordinates all actors</li>
<li>actor: anything implementing the <code>Actor</code> trait to create new actor instances and handle receiving messages</li>
<li>actor instance: an instance of the actor struct that has internal state and is tracked by the actor system</li>
<li>actor ref(erence): an ActorRef<MyProtocol> that can tell messages to the actor instance it references via. the actor system</li>
</ul>
<p>The actor reference is a &quot;killer feature&quot; of Riker for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>known size at compile, safe as properties of structs/enums</li>
<li>small size, almost free to clone</li>
<li>safe to share across threads and copy, no Arc reference counting, no locks, etc.</li>
<li>safe to drop (the actor system maintains a URI style lookup)</li>
<li>known type, no onerous generic trait handling</li>
<li>no onerous lifetimes</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Holochain and blockchain are built for fundamentally different use cases. Blockchain is relatively good for systems where it’s absolutely necessary to maintain global consensus. Holochain is much better than blockchain at anything that requires less than universal consensus (most things): It’s faster, more efficient, more scalable, adaptable, and extendable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long before blockchains were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain">hash chains</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">hash trees</a>. These structures can be used to ensure tamper-proof data integrity as progressive versions or additions to data are made. These kinds of hashes are often used as reference points to ensure data hasn't been messed with—like making sure you're getting the program you meant to download, not some virus in its place.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/perspectives-on-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies-7ef391605bd1#.kmous6d7z">their own signed hash chain</a> (<a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae#.u1idviscz">countersigned for transactions</a> involving others). After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> where every node runs the same validation rules (like blockchain nodes all run the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation">same validation rules</a>. If someone breaks those rules, the DHT rejects their data—their chain has forked away from the holochain.</p>
<p>The initial <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a> introduced a blockchain as an architecture for decentralized production of a chain of digital currency transactions. This solved two problems (time/sequence of transactions, and randomizing who writes to the chain) with one main innovation of bundling transactions into blocks which somebody wins the prize of being able to commit to the chain if they <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hashcash">solve a busywork problem</a> faster than others.</p>
<p>Now Bitcoin and blockchain have pervaded people's consciousness and many perceive it as a solution for all sorts of decentralized applications. However, when the problems are framed slightly differently, there are much more efficient and elegant solutions (like holochains) which don't have the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blockchain+bottleneck">processing bottlenecks</a> of global consensus, storage requirements of everyone having a <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size">FULL copy</a> of all the data, or <a href="https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/essay-of-the-day-bitcoin-mining-and-its-energy-footprint/2015/12/20">wasting so much electricity </a> on busywork.</p>

<p><strong>DHT (Distributed Hash Table)</strong> leverages cryptographic hashes for content addressable storage, while randomizing of interactions by hashing into neighborhoods to impede collusion, and processing validation #1 and #2 to store data on the DHT.</p>

<a class="header" href="#holographic-storage" id="holographic-storage"><h3><em>Holo</em>graphic storage</h3></a>
<p>Every node has a resilient sample of the whole. Like cutting a hologram, if you were to cut a Holochain network in half (make it so half the nodes were isolated from the other half), you would have two whole, functioning systems, not two partial, broken systems.</p>
<p>This seems to be the strategy used to create resilience in natural systems. For example, where is your DNA stored? Every cell carries its own copy, with different functions expressed based on the role of that cell.</p>
<p>Where is the English language stored? Every speaker carries it. People have different areas of expertise, or exposure to different slang or specialized vocabularies. Nobody has a complete copy, nor is anyone's version exactly the same as anyone else, If you disappeared half of the English speakers, it would not degrade the language much.</p>
<p>If you keep cutting a hologram smaller and smaller eventually the image degrades enough to stop being recognizable, and depending on the resiliency rules for DHT neighborhoods, holochains would likely share a similar fate. Although, if the process of killing off the nodes was not instantaneous, the network may be able to keep reshuffling data per redundancy requirements to keep it alive.</p>

<p>Holochains are composable with each other into new levels of unification. In other words, Holochains can build on decentralized capacities provided by other Holochains, making new holistic patterns possible. Like bodies build new unity on holographic storage patterns that cells use for DNA, and a society build new unity on the holographic storage patterns of language, and so on.</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-is-holochain-different-from-a-dht-distributed-hash-table" id="how-is-holochain-different-from-a-dht-distributed-hash-table"><h2>How is Holochain different from a DHT (Distributed Hash Table)?</h2></a>
<p>DHTs enable key/value pair storage and retrieval across many machines. The only validation rules they have is the hash of the data itself to confirm what you're getting is probably what you intended to get. They have no other means to confirm authenticity, provenance, timelines, or integrity of data sources.</p>
<p>In fact, since many DHTs are used for illegal file sharing (Napster, Bittorrent, Sharezaa, etc.), they are designed to protect anonymity of uploaders so they won't get in trouble. File sharing DHTs frequently serve virus infected files, planted by uploaders trying to infect digital pirates. There's no accountability for actions or reliable way to ensure bad data doesn't spread.</p>
<p>By embedding validation rules as a condition for the propagation of data, our DHT keeps its data bound to signed source chains. This can provide similar consistency and rule enforcement as blockchain ledgers asynchronously so bottlenecks of immediate consensus become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>The DHT leverages the signed source chains to ensure tamper-proof immutability of data, as well as cryptographic signatures to verify its origins and provenance.</p>
<p>The Holochain DHT also emulates aspects of a graph database by enabling people to connect links to other hashes in the DHT tagged with semantic markers. This helps solve the problem of finding the hashes that you want to retrieve from the DHT. For example, if I have the hash of your user identity, I could query it for links to blogs you've published to a holochain so that I can find them without knowing either the hash or the content. This is part of how we eliminate the need for tracking nodes that many DHTs rely on.</p>

<a class="header" href="#what-is-holochain-not-good-for" id="what-is-holochain-not-good-for"><h2>What is Holochain <em>not</em> good for?</h2></a>
<p>You probably should not use Holochain for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Just yourself:</strong> You generally don't need distributed tools to just run something for yourself. The exception would be if you want to run a holochain to synchronize certain data across a bunch of your devices (phone, laptop, desktop, cloud server, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymous, secret, or private data:</strong> Not only do we need to do a security audit of our encryption and permissions, but you're publishing to a shared DHT space, so unless you really know what you're doing, you should not assume data is private. Some time in the future, I'm sure some applications will add an anonymization layer (like TOR), but that is not native.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large files:</strong> Think of holochains more like a database than a file system. Nobody wants to be forced to load and host your big files on their devices just because they are in the neighborhood of its hash. Use something like IPFS if you want a decentralized file system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data positivist-oriented apps:</strong> If you have built all of your application logic around the idea that data exists as an absolute truth, not as an assertion by an agent at a time, then you would need to rethink your whole approach before putting it in a Holochain app. This is why most existing cryptocurrencies would need significant refactoring to move from blockchain to Holochain, since they are organized around managing the existence of cryptographic tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-holochains-consensus-algorithm" id="what-is-holochains-consensus-algorithm"><h2>What is Holochain's consensus algorithm?</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Holochains don't manage consensus, at least not about some absolute perspective on data or sequence of events. They manage distributed data integrity. Holochains do rely on consensus about the validation rules (DNA) which define that integrity, but so does every blockchain or blockchain alternative (e.g. Bitcoin Core). If you have different validation rules, you're not on the same chain. These validation rules establish the &quot;data physics,&quot; and then applications are built on that foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In making Holochain, our goal is to keep it &quot;as simple as possible, but no simpler&quot; for providing data integrity for fully distributed applications. As we understand it, information integrity does not require consensus about an absolute order of events. You know how we know? Because the real world works this way—meaning, the physically distributed systems outside of computers. Atoms, molecules, cells, bodies each maintain the integrity of their individual and collective state just fine without consensus on a global ledger.</p>
<p>Not only is there no consensus about an absolute order of events, but if you understand the General Theory of Relativity, then you'll understand there is in fact no real sequence of events, only sequences relative to a particular vantage point.</p>
<p>That's how holochains are implemented. Each source chain for each person/agent/participant in a Holochain preserves the immutable data integrity and order of events of that agent's actions from their vantage point. As data is published from a source chain to the validating DHT, then other agents sign their validation, per the shared &quot;physics&quot; encoded into the DNA of that Holochain.</p>
<p>The minor exception to the singular vantage point of each chain, is the case when a multi-party transaction is signed to each party's chain. That is an act of consensus—but consensus on a very small scale—just between the parties involved in the transaction. Each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. Luckily, it's pretty easy to reach consensus between 2 or 3 parties. In fact, that is already why they're doing a transaction together, because they all agree to it.</p>
<p>Holochains do sign every change of data and timestamp (without a universal time synchronization solution). This provides ample foundation for most applications which need solid data integrity for shared data in a fully distributed multi-agent system. Surely, there will be people who will build consensus algorithms on top of that foundation (maybe like rounds, witnesses, supermajorities of <a href="https://www.swirlds.com/">Swirlds</a>).</p>
<p>However, if your system is designed around data having one absolute true state, not one which is dynamic and varied based on vantage point, we would suggest you rethink your design. So far, for every problem space where people thought they needed an absolute sequence of events or global consensus, we have been able to map an alternate approach without those requirements. Also, we already know this is how the world outside of computers works, so to design your system to require (or construct) an artificial reality is probably setting yourself up for failure, or at the very least for massive amounts of unnecessary computation, communication, and fragility within your system.</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-is-holochain-more-environmentally-ethical-than-blockchain" id="how-is-holochain-more-environmentally-ethical-than-blockchain"><h2>How is Holochain more environmentally ethical than blockchain?</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Holochain removes the need for global consensus, and with it the expenditure of massive amounts of electricity to synchronize millions of nodes about data that aren't relevant to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two reasons Holochain is vastly more efficient than blockchain and more ethical in a green sense:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It eliminates the need for all nodes to be synchronized with each other in global consensus. Sharding is usually enabled on Holochain. This means that when two nodes make a transaction, each node saves a countersigned record of that transaction. Additionally, the transaction is published to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhF_kvgfEZM">Distributed Hash Table</a> (sent to and saved by some unpredictably random nodes that can be looked up later for retrieval).</p>
<p>Sharding is configurable by app, and in some cases it's a good idea to turn it off. For example, imagine a distributed Slack-like team messaging app. With only 40-50 members, full synchronization would be worth the extra bandwidth requirement for the benefit of offline messages and reduced load times. But for most applications, global synchronization isn't really needed and sharding is kept on.</p>
<p>Because of DHTs, and the sharding they enable, Holochain actually doesn't rely on the transfer of large amounts of redundant information, and uses vastly less bandwidth than blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's no mining on Holochain. Blockchain's proof-of-work system provides a hefty incentive for thousands of people to spend the processing power of their CPUs and GPUs using up <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">huge amounts</a> <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywbbpm/bitcoin-mining-electricity-consumption-ethereum-energy-climate-change">of electricity</a> on solving a meaningless cryptographic puzzle. Holochain doesn't have mining.</p>

What languages can I use to make Holochain apps?</h2></a>
<p>Holochain is written in the Rust programming language. At a low level, Holochain runs WebAssembly code, but for all practical purposes developers will write applications in a language that compiles to WebAssembly such as Rust, C, C++, Go, etc. For now, only Rust has tier 1 support for writing apps, because it has a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/tree/develop/hdk-rust">&quot;Holochain Development Kit&quot; library</a> which makes writing WebAssembly apps easy.</p>
<a class="header" href="#is-holochain-open-source" id="is-holochain-open-source"><h2>Is Holochain open source?</h2></a>
<p>Yes, it has an open source <a href="https://github.com/Holochain/holochain-rust/#license">license</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#can-you-run-a-cryptocurrency-on-holochain" id="can-you-run-a-cryptocurrency-on-holochain"><h2>Can you run a cryptocurrency on Holochain?</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Theoretically, yes—but for the moment, we'd discourage it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't know how to issue currencies through mutual credit, or how to account for them through double entry accounting, then you probably shouldn't build one on Holochain. If you do understand those key principles, than it is not very difficult to build a cryptocurrency for which Holochain provides ample accounting and data integrity.</p>
<p>However, you probably shouldn't try to do it in the way everyone is used to building cryptocurrencies on a global ledger of cryptographic tokens. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending">Determining the status of tokens/coins</a> is what create the need for global consensus (about the existence/status/validity of the token or coin). However, there are <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/perspectives-on-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies-7ef391605bd1">other approaches to making currencies</a> which, for example, involve <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">issuance via mutual credit</a> instead of issuance by fiat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a hotly contested topic by many who often don't have a deep understanding of currency design nor cryptography, so we're not going to go too deep in this FAQ. We intend to publish a white paper on this topic soon, as well as launch some currencies built this way.</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-are-data-validated-on-holochain" id="how-are-data-validated-on-holochain"><h2>How are data validated on Holochain?</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>On Holochain, each node that receives a record of a transaction validates it against the shared application rules and gossips it to their peers. If the rules are broken, that transaction is rejected by the validator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no overall, global &quot;correctness&quot; (or consensus) built in to Holochain. Instead, each node that receives a record of a transaction validates it against the shared application rules and gossips it to their peers. If the rules are broken, that transaction is rejected by the validator. If foul play is detected on a node's part (the node is either propagating or validating bad data) that node is blocked and a warning is sent to others. Here's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bjp7Txg.png">an infographic</a> describing this process. In summary, instead of a global consensus system, Holochain uses an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVTnEKxwYls&amp;t=1s">accountability-based system</a> with data validation by peers.</p>
<p>Applying this to the example of 'Ourbnb', an imaginary distributed version ofAirbnb: The Ourbnb Holochain app would certainly be written with a rule, &quot;don't rent your apartment to two parties at the same time.&quot; So the moment a user rents to two parties at the same time, nodes receiving that datum on the DHT attempt to validate it against the app rules, detect a collision, and reject it. Holochain's gossip protocol is designed to operate at a rate at which collisions will be detected nearly immediately by gossiping peers. And since Holochain doesn't have a coin built into it, it incentivizes users to cooperate and co-create.</p>
<p>As a user, you don't need to trust the provider of the application you're using, only agree with the shared protocols that make up the application itself. Aside from being responsible for the maintenance and security of apps they provide, application providers on Holochain are not like traditional application providers today (think Facebook, Twitter, etc.). They don't host your data because your data is stored by you and a random subset of the users of the application.</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-happens-to-data-when-a-node-leaves-the-network" id="what-happens-to-data-when-a-node-leaves-the-network"><h2>What happens to data when a node leaves the network?</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>The DHT of a Holochain app makes sure that there are always enough nodes on the network that hold a given datum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When people running Holochain apps turn off their device, they leave the network. What happens to their data and the data of other people they were storing? There are always enough nodes that hold a given piece of data in the network so as to prevent data loss when nodes leave. The DHT and Holochain gossip protocol are designed this way. Also, the redundancy factor of data on a given DHT is configurable so it can be fine-tuned for any purpose. For example, a chat app for a small team might set a redundancy factor of 100% in order to prevent long loading times, while an app with thousands of users might have a very small redundancy factor.</p>
<a class="header" href="#should-i-build-my-cointoken-on-holochain" id="should-i-build-my-cointoken-on-holochain"><h2>Should I build my coin/token on Holochain?</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Since it's agent-centric instead of data-centric like traditional blockchains, Holochain isn't the best platform on which to build a token or coin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of tokens or coins is a direct representation of a system being data-centric. While theoretically it would be possible to create a token on Holochain, it would be taking a step back instead of a step forward. The more exciting possibility is creating mutual credit currencies on Holochain. These are agent-centric currencies that are designed to facilitate active exchange of value and flourishing ecosystems instead of hoarding.</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-does-agent-centric-mean-how-is-this-different-from-data-centric" id="what-does-agent-centric-mean-how-is-this-different-from-data-centric"><h2>What does “agent-centric” mean? How is this different from “data-centric?”</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Agent-centric systems view data not as an object, but as a shared experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditional blockchains are data-centric: they rely on and are built around the concept that data is a thing—an object. Holochain transitions to agent-centricism: the idea that data is shared experiences seen from many points of view. It's not a thing. It's a collection of shared, relative experiences. Einstein discovered this about the physical world a hundred years ago—Relativity. So why are modern blockchains that are supposedly &quot;cutting edge&quot; still falling back on this antiquated idea that data is an object, and for two agents to have different views of one piece of data is wrong?</p>
<p>Holochain is deeply agent-centric. Using tech that embodies this mindset enables vastly richer interactions and collaboration to happen through its technology while at the same time being thousands of times more efficient.</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-the-tps-transactions-per-second-on-holochain" id="what-is-the-tps-transactions-per-second-on-holochain"><h2>What is the TPS (Transactions Per Second) on Holochain?</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Holochain doesn't have a set TPS (transactions per second) like other blockchain-based or blockchain-derived projects might because there's central point through which all transactions must pass. Instead, Holochain is a generalized protocol for distributed computing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's common to ask a blockchain project, &quot;How much can your technology handle? What's its TPS?&quot; This is because nearly all of these projects are built around the limiting idea of a global ledger.</p>
<p>But you are not asking, how many posts per second Facebook can do. Why? Because there is no technical problem, adding more servers to Facebook's data center (only maybe monetary problems).</p>
<p>You are not asking how many emails per second the internet can handle, because there is no single bottleneck for email-sending, like there would be with a centralized approach.</p>
<p>Why are we seeing a transaction limit with blockchain networks? Because blockchain in a strange way marries a decentralized p2p network of nodes with the logical notion of one absolute truth, i.e. the blockchain being one big decentralized database of transactions. It tries to maintain this way of thinking about apps that we are used to from centralized servers. It forces every node into the same &quot;consensus&quot;. That is implemented by having everybody share and validate everything. That does work, and maybe there are few usecases (like a global naming system maybe?) where it might be advantageous.. but applying that for everything is nonsensical.</p>
<p>Holochain is not forcing such a model. Instead it allows for building applications that are like email. The application is rather like a protocol, or grammar, or (I prefer this language) like a dance. If you know the dance (If you have a copy of the validation rules of the app) you can tell who else is dancing that dance and who is not. The difference between Holochain and something like email is that (similarly to blockhain) Holochain is applying 1. cryptographic signatures and 2. tamper proof hash-chains (hence Holo<em>chain</em>) so that you can build a distributed system you can trust in. You know it is impossible (I'd rather say: very very hard) to game somebody. This so far was only possible by having trusted authorities like banks or Facebook.</p>
<p>So, Holochain as an app framework does not pose any limit of transactions per second because there is no place where all transactions have to go through. It is like asking, &quot;how many words can humanity speak per second?&quot; Well, with every human being born, that number increases. Same for Holochain.</p>

<p>First, read about <a href="/state/actors.html">state actors</a>.</p>
<p>The 1:1 API implementation between actors and their inner table is achieved by
internally blocking on an <code>ask</code> from riker patterns.</p>
<p>https://github.com/riker-rs/riker-patterns</p>
<p>The actor ref methods implementing <code>HashTable</code> sends messages to itself.</p>
<p>Calling <code>table_actor_ref.commit(entry)</code> looks like this:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>the actor ref constructs a <code>Protocol::PutPair</code> message including the entry</li>
<li>the actor ref calls its own <code>ask</code> method, which builds a future using riker's <code>ask</code></li>
<li>the actor ref blocks on its internal future</li>
<li>the referenced actor receives the <code>Commit</code> message and matches/destructures this into the entry</li>
<li>the entry is passed to the <code>commit()</code> method of the inner table</li>
<li>the actor's inner table, implementing <code>HashTable</code>, does something with commit (e.g. MemTable inserts into a standard Rust, in-memory <code>HashMap</code>)</li>
<li>the return value of the inner table <code>commit</code> is inserted into a <code>CommitResult</code> message</li>
<li>the <code>CommitResult</code> message is sent by the actor back to the actor ref's internal future</li>
<li>the actor ref stops blocking</li>
<li>the <code>CommitResult</code> message is destructured by the actor ref so that the return of <code>commit</code> satisfies the <code>HashTable</code> trait implementation</li>
</ol>
<p>Riker <code>ask</code> returns a future from the futures <code>0.2.2</code> crate.</p>
<p><code>table_actor.block_on_ask()</code> calls <code>block_on</code> and <code>unwrap</code> against this ask.</p>
<p>Both the block and the unwrap should be handled better in the future.</p>
